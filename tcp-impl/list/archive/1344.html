<BR>
42nd IETF, Chicago 
<BR>
August 28, 1998
<BR>
<P>Reported by Evi Nemeth, with editing by the chairs &amp; Sally Floyd.
<BR>
<P>Agenda:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Agenda bashing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Scott Bradner, intellectual property rights
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Status
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Known problems I-D
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  Security problems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  RFC 2001 revision (congestion control)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.  WG closing after Orlando
<BR>
<P><P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
<BR>
<P>1.  Agenda bashing:
<BR>
<P>No changes to the agenda.
<BR>
<P><P>2.  IPR (intellectual property rights) issues:
<BR>
<P>Scott Bradner reminded the group that if you know of intellectual
<BR>
property issues in your company on a topic and don't say so, then
<BR>
you cannot participate in the discussion and decisions regarding
<BR>
that topic.  This is outlined in RFC 2028.
<BR>
<P><P>3.  Status
<BR>
<P>The testing tools document is done, RFC 2398.  The larger initial
<BR>
window documents have been approved by IESG, and the 3 drafts will
<BR>
soon become RFCs.  Regarding the restart of idle connections, see
<BR>
draft-ietf-tcpimpl-restart, which Joe Touch reports will soon be
<BR>
revised for publication.
<BR>
<P><P>4.  Known problems
<BR>
<P>7 new ones have been documented since the LA meeting.  Bill Fenner
<BR>
described a new bug: if during a bi-directional transfer you are
<BR>
sending and so is the other end, but you're not reading the incoming
<BR>
data very fast, you can end up deadlocked with a full buffer.  For
<BR>
example, a multithreaded client-server where one thread is sending a
<BR>
lot, another is receiving a lot, but using one tcp connection.  The
<BR>
fix is to change an unsigned to an int and recognize -1 as a valid
<BR>
value.  Bill will explain it better and submit it.
<BR>
<P>There are 3 others which are less serious and also not yet
<BR>
addressed.  The document will be forwarded to the IESG without
<BR>
outlining these bugs.
<BR>
<P><P>5.  Security problems
<BR>
<P>There is a list of known problems:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictable initial sequence number
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SYN flooding
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land attack
<BR>
Phil Karn noted that the latter two are really denial of service
<BR>
attacks, and questioned the title of the section.
<BR>
<P><P>6.  RFC 2001 revision
<BR>
<P>High-level sketch of the revisions:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- removed ambiguities
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- fixes for fast retransmit and fast recovery
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- added discussion of SACK
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- added larger initial window pointer
<BR>
<P>The discussion of the 2001 revision was a little chaotic at this
<BR>
point and went back and forth between several topics.  The comments
<BR>
about each topic have been grouped together for the minutes, and
<BR>
therefore the comments are somewhat out-of-order.
<BR>
<P>Sally Floyd described two separate modifications to the Fast Retransmit
<BR>
and Fast Recovery algorithms in RFC 2001.  The first modification is
<BR>
the NewReno algorithm, introduced in Janey Hoe's SIGCOMM 96 paper,
<BR>
which improves TCP's response to a &quot;partial ack&quot; received during Fast
<BR>
Recovery, acknowledging some but not all of the packets sent before
<BR>
Fast Recovery was initiated.  The preferred TCP algorithms would be
<BR>
those of Sack TCP.  However, when the SACK option is not available, the
<BR>
NewReno algorithm was described as a small but important change to make
<BR>
to Reno TCP, avoiding Reno TCP's well-documented problems with
<BR>
retransmit timeouts when multiple packets are dropped from a window of
<BR>
data.
<BR>
<P>The second modification described was the bugfix algorithm for avoiding
<BR>
unnecessary multiple fast retransmits.  This problem occurs in Reno
<BR>
when, after a retransmit timeout, packets are retransmitted that have
<BR>
already been received at the receiver.  When the TCP sender receives
<BR>
three duplicate ACKs acknowledging three retransmitted packets, the
<BR>
sender can incorrectly interpret this as a new instance of congestion.
<BR>
Simulations showed that the NewReno algorighm and the bugfix for
<BR>
avoiding-multiple-fast-retransmits are orthogonal - it is possible to
<BR>
implement one and not the other.  However, while it is possible to
<BR>
create scenarios with Reno or NewReno TCP where the bugfix for
<BR>
avoiding-multiple-fast-retransmits would be helpful, it is not 
<BR>
possible to create the pathological scenarios that can occur with Tahoe
<BR>
TCP (e.g., TCP with Fast Retransmit but without Fast Recovery).
<BR>

<BR>
&quot;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/talks/sf-tcpimpl-aug98.ps">ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/talks/sf-tcpimpl-aug98.ps</A>&quot; (postscript), and
<BR>
&quot;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/talks/sf-tcpimpl-aug98.pdf">ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/talks/sf-tcpimpl-aug98.pdf</A>&quot; (PDF).
<BR>
<P>The chairs think that NewReno is a good thing; folks should implement it
<BR>
(solaris 2.6 might already) and put out an experimental RFC or include it
<BR>
(all or part) in 2001.
<BR>
<P>The decision was made to take this discussion to the mailing list and do an
<BR>
experimental RFC with NewReno, rather than include it in the bugs list 
<BR>
in RFC 2001.
<BR>
<P>There was then discussion of whether to include Sally's Reno
<BR>
modification for avoiding-multiple-fast-retransmits in the RFC 2001
<BR>
revision - how much experience with it do we need to include it?
<BR>
<P>Vern suggested that an experimental document with Sally's modification
<BR>
could come out at the same time, and be referenced by 2001.
<BR>
<P>Kacheong Poon (Sun) confirmed that some implementations of NewReno can
<BR>
behave like stop and go during retransmission (like in Janey Hoe's
<BR>
paper).  This occurs when multiple packets are dropped from a window of
<BR>
data, and NewReno TCP recovers by retransmitting at most one dropped
<BR>
packet per roundtrip time.
<BR>
<P>Sally said it is possible to implement NewReno with &quot;stop and go&quot;
<BR>
behavior, but that in an alternate implementation, included as an
<BR>
option in the NS simulator, the retransmit timer is reset on only the
<BR>
first retransmission.  In this case, instead of slowly recovering by
<BR>
retransmitting at most one dropped packet per roundtrip time,
<BR>
eventually the retransmit timer times out and the sender slow-starts.
<BR>
The first-order fix for problems with multiple packets dropped from a
<BR>
window of data is to use Sack, but when Sack is not available, NewReno
<BR>
with this implementation should not perform worse than Reno.
<BR>
<P>Sally and Kacheong Poon agreed to confer on different possible
<BR>
implementations of NewReno.
<BR>
<P>Phil Karn asked if we want to make TCP more aggressive in the face of
<BR>
multiple packets dropped.  Sally answered: multiple packets dropped in a
<BR>
window of data is one instance of congestion.  So cut the window in half,
<BR>
do one retransmit; if retransmitted packets get lost, then it's more serious
<BR>
and do slow start.
<BR>
<P>The RFC 2001 discussion continued with a discussion of ACKing every
<BR>
second full sized segment being a MUST and not a SHOULD.  A wording
<BR>
tweak is needed: that ACKing is *at least* every second full-sized
<BR>
packet, since some systems ACK every segment, and that's allowed.
<BR>
<P>&lt;There was a comment here about satellite environments which the
<BR>
&nbsp;note-taker didn't get recorded - anyone recall it?&gt;
<BR>
<P>Another issue arose concerning ACK every 2nd full sized segment --
<BR>
there's no way for the receiver to really know if the segments
<BR>
arriving are full-sized.  Resolution: loosen the language but word
<BR>
it so that today's TCPs are ok.
<BR>
<P>A question regarding definition of 3 duplicate ACKs - must they be
<BR>
consecutive?  Answer: yes, they need to be consecutive, but it's
<BR>
rare that they're not, so should not cause an implementation to be
<BR>
labeled non-conformant.
<BR>
<P>7.  WG closing after Orlando
<BR>
<P>2001 is almost done if NewReno is not included.  The plan is to
<BR>
close the working group after the next meeting (in Orlando).
<BR>
However, in discussion after adjournment, the issue was raised of
<BR>
documenting PMTU discovery issues, which may merit keeping the WG
<BR>
active for one more meeting.
