<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Charles Hannum really should submit his &quot;T/TCP Considered Harmful&quot; as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; an informational RFC at some point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's only a few pages, and was in the end2end archives (13 Sep 1996),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so here it is.
</EM><BR>
<P>I actually submitted it to rfc-editor around the same time.  I never
<BR>
received a response, and I'm not sure it was ever published as a draft.
<BR>
<P>It's interesting (amusing?) to note that, on 19980407 (19 months after
<BR>
my draft was originally sent out), an exploit for the `Host-Based
<BR>
Authorization' hole against FreeBSD was published on bugtraq.  A patch
<BR>
was issued ~1 month later, which was intended to disable the accepting
<BR>
of a connection count for services which did not explicitly request
<BR>
T/TCP on the listening socket (a workaround which I had forgotten to
<BR>
mention in the draft), but the patch was broken and went through
<BR>
several revisions.  I don't know what the current status of this is.
<BR>
<P>The problems related to SYN flooding and sequence number attacks have
<BR>
never been addressed -- nor has the compatibility issue with old TCP
<BR>
implementations mentioned in passing in the conclusions section (which
<BR>
I can explain better if anyone is interested), which I believe has
<BR>
been shown to affect communication with some embedded TCP
<BR>
implementations.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, the case that T/TCP was originally designed for (HTTP)
<BR>
has been more or less resolved by changing the application layer
<BR>
anyway.  So I wonder if there is even a point in discussing T/TCP any
<BR>
more.
