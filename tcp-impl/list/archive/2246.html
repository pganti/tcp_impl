<P>
<EM>&gt; I've actually written 75% of this draft and included Jerry's codes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that he helpfully sent me three years ago!  Also as far as I am aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mentat is the ONLY TCP stack in wide circulation to use these codes.
</EM><BR>
<P>ONLY has no relevance to WIDE; it's the ONLY or it's not.
<BR>
<P>The problem with data in the stream is multi-dimensional. First of all,
<BR>
the specs let anybody do anything, and I guarantee that somebody is
<BR>
doing something that won't be appreciated. It is highly likely that
<BR>
there are at least a few implementations which (1) use some format you
<BR>
do not, (2) leave binary data as leftovers in the RST, or (3) will do
<BR>
something else in the future since the spec allows it.
<BR>
<P>If we are going to standardize on the interpretation of errors, then the
<BR>
representation should be standardized in such a way that interpretation
<BR>
is not likely. Reverse-standardizing on legacy representations does not
<BR>
satisfy that objective. In other words, if we find out that in some
<BR>
particular scenario there are many stacks which leave binary junk in the
<BR>
data stream for RST then your spec will be instantly broken.
<BR>
<P>To wit:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I followed the FTP/SMTP code / string idea in the draft as Rick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested
</EM><BR>
<P>That will make legacy Mentat implementations non-compliant, and will
<BR>
require coding around.
<BR>
<P>The primary benefit of an RST option is that the representation of the
<BR>
failure is removed from the datastream, guaranteeing that the only
<BR>
implementations who do anything with it are the implementations who know
<BR>
WHAT to do with it explicitly.
<BR>
<P>A secondary benefit is that TEXT data is not required, but instead there
<BR>
is room for explicit codes/types in 2 bytes of option data (four bytes
<BR>
if you include all the option overhead which isn't necessary with
<BR>
options that are not variable-length).
<BR>
<P>Trying to do this in the free-form datastream is a bad idea all around,
<BR>
I believe.
