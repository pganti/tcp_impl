<EM>&gt; &gt; Suppose each has a receive buffer of 8KBytes. Then 10K connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; requires 800MBytes from somewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Perhaps someone else can suggest where.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most TCPs (at least, BSD based TCPs) don't pre-allocate receive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buffers.  So, 10K idle connections don't use up any memory for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buffers, just the memory for the connection state.  The usual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place where buffers sit around awhile is on the send side, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP is waiting for an ACK of the data.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but as I'm sure Dave knows, that connection state can amount to a
<BR>
few MBytes when multipled by 10K.  Exactly how much depends on the
<BR>
implementation.  Then there are the other resources needed for each of
<BR>
those connections such as:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- kernel process table slot, stack, etc (if you have a process/connection)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- user space equivalent of kernel process state (if you have a thread each)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- user space application state for each connection, such as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authentication, authorization, and encryption values, current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;location&quot;/database-key/whatever, accounting/usage counts.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need none of that, then why use TCP?  Why not go at least
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as &quot;stateless&quot; as NFS/UDP?
<BR>
<P>Also, if you have 10K connections, you might need to send to many of them
<BR>
simultaneously, say when 10K users get back from their tea breaks or when
<BR>
big football game pauses, and they all hit the ENTER key.   You might need
<BR>
more than 8KBytes of output buffering for each of many of your 10K
<BR>
connections.  (8K is puny in the late 1990's.)
<BR>
<P>Over the years, I've seen attempts to grow various systems in various
<BR>
arenas (not just TCP connections).  Order-of-magnitude changes in size
<BR>
bring major qualitative changes.  People who expected to just crank up
<BR>
table sizes from 1 to 10 to 100 to ... and see things work have always (!)
<BR>
been amazed that I and my fellow pessimists have been proven right. 
<BR>
<P>If you need to ask what might break at 10K TCP connections, it would be
<BR>
best to find someone who's &quot;been there; done that&quot;, or at least &quot;tried to
<BR>
do that.&quot;  Things are very different above 1000 connections compared to
<BR>
less than 100, and even people very experienced with smaller TCP systems
<BR>
are often surprised.  I suspect that's related to what the other people
<BR>
who have responded have been hinting at.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>P.S. about any outfit that has sold systems to customers wanting to support
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;at least 1000 users (for most meanings of &quot;user&quot;) has had to fiddle with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the old BSD anonymous port selection limits.  Consider big universities
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or big WWW servers, as well as AOL, GTE, AT&amp;T, etc.
