<EM>&gt; &gt; From: william Li &lt;<A HREF="mailto:liw@ascend.com?Subject=Re:%20a%20question%20about%20SYN%20attack&In-Reply-To=&lt;969378667.0023@hypermail.dummy&gt;">liw@ascend.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is the syn_cooky solusion. I believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vernon's random_drop solusion super-set this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one. Does anyone have info about the radom_drop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; solusion ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the syn-cooky solution was different, and neither a super-set,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sub-set, extension, or precursor of random-drop.  I also don't like it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Correct.  The idea behind the syn-cookie is that when a SYN is received,
<BR>
send out the SYN/ACK, and forget about the connection.  When the ACK
<BR>
is received, the connection is then created.  But to avoid switching
<BR>
the SYN attack to an ACK attack, some magic encoding is done in the
<BR>
sequence number in the SYN/ACK, so that when the ACK is received, it
<BR>
can be verified whether or not it is in response to a SYN/ACK that we
<BR>
sent out.  The issues with syn-cookies is how to do that encoding,
<BR>
and if you have to drop to a lower level of service due to lack of
<BR>
bits for encoding state information (like TCP window scale option).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Dave Borman's solution can be viewed as a superset of random drop.  He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switched to a hash table to find TCB's, something that everyone who deals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with large numbers of sockets must do to avoid performance problems.  He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also changed things so that much less state is kept for each partly open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection.  When that table overflowed, he picked an arbitrary,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonably random connection to throw out of the table.  That last bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of picking a random connection to give up on instead of either the classic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.*BSD tactic of the newest connection or other systems' giving up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the oldest connection is crux of random-drop.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it's not exactly random drop.  Each hash bucket has a limit, and
<BR>
the overall table has a limit.  When we decide that we need to drop a
<BR>
connection due to either limit being exceeded, we drop the oldest connection
<BR>
on the hash bucket where we are trying to put the new connection.
<BR>
The hashing function is designed to be non-predictable (from the outside),
<BR>
so that there is a fairly good distribution across all the buckets.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Has something happened to BSDI?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>No, other than our ISP had a 48 hour outage between POPs that knocked us
<BR>
off the net for 48 hours (compounded by anyone trying to call BSDI on
<BR>
Monday not being able to get anyone, since the main office was closed
<BR>
for Columbus Day.)
