One of the things I'd like to better understand from the results
<BR>
that were presented at the BOF is the frequency of &quot;bad&quot; 
<BR>
implementations to &quot;good&quot; implementations that was observed.
<BR>
While its interesting that you can scan TCPdumps and pick out
<BR>
particularly evil characteristics of an implementation, its not
<BR>
necessarily a problem worth fixing if the implementation is
<BR>
relatively rare.  Obviously, a majorly flawed implementation of,
<BR>
say, the Win95 stack, is a bigger operational problem than 
<BR>
a flawed implementation of an Atari2600 stack.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to propose that one of the goals of the group to come 
<BR>
up with a list of &quot;good&quot; characteristics, perhaps document them
<BR>
as a BCP, and let vendors saythey conform to the BCP.
<BR>
<P>I'd also like to support Fred's interest in TCP over satellite,
<BR>
especially high bandwidth flows.
