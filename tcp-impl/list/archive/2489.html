&lt;&lt; OUR APOLOGIES FOR MULTIPLE COPIES &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>CALL FOR PAPERS for Special Sessions in
<BR>
the Fourth IFIP/IEEE International Conference on
<BR>
Management of Multimedia Networks and Services (MMNS'2001)
<BR>
<P>October 29- November 1, 2001, Chicago, Illinois, USA
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.mnlab.cs.depaul.edu/mmns2001">http://www.mnlab.cs.depaul.edu/mmns2001</A>)
<BR>
<P>IMPORTANT DATES
<BR>
Submission deadline:    April 20, 2001
<BR>
Notification of acceptance:  July 1, 2001
<BR>
Final version due:    July 21, 2001
<BR>
<P>MMNS has identified a number ``focus topics'' that are of particular
<BR>
relevance and importance to the field of multimedia network and service
<BR>
management. MMNS plans to conduct special sessions to address such hot
<BR>
issues. Papers submitted to these special sessions will go through the
<BR>
normal submission and review procedure. The goal is to build special
<BR>
sessions of exceptional papers all dealing with a closely related theme.
<BR>
The set of focus topics include the following:
<BR>
<P>* INTERNET TRAFFIC MONITORING:  The focus of this special session
<BR>
is on techniques and methodologies for collecting Internet traffic
<BR>
statistics,
<BR>
descriptions of collection systems implemented and deployed in the
<BR>
Internet, results from these systems, and analyses of these results
<BR>
describing how multimedia networks and services can be better managed.
<BR>
For questions about this special session, contact Kevin Almeroth
<BR>
(<A HREF="mailto:almeroth@cs.ucsb.edu?Subject=Re:%20CFP%20for%20Special%20Sessions%20in%20MMNS'2001&In-Reply-To=&lt;002101c0b833$76a372c0$05c3fe40@cti.depaul.edu&gt;">almeroth@cs.ucsb.edu</A>).
<BR>
<P>* Multimedia in AD-HOC NETWORKS: Networks of the future are envisioned
<BR>
to integrate the Internet with wireless mobile embedded devices and
<BR>
ad-hoc networks. Ad-hoc networks are collections of wireless mobile
<BR>
nodes that can be deployed rapidly without pre-existing or centralized
<BR>
communication  infrastructure. These networks should support various
<BR>
types of multimedia traffic, including audio, video, TC-based data,
<BR>
and sensory data. Due to the nature of ad-hoc networks, number of new
<BR>
challenges must be addressed in order to facilitate seamless services of
<BR>
Ad-hoc networks. This includes unicast and multicast routing protocols,
<BR>
power-aware protocols in almost all layers of the network stack, quality
<BR>
and guarantee of service provisioning for multimedia traffic,
<BR>
self-configuring hierarchies and architectures, address allocation and
<BR>
naming,
<BR>
data dissemination techniques, efficient mobility support, fault and
<BR>
performance
<BR>
management tools, performance analysis of end-to-end protocols such as TCP
<BR>
and reliable multicast over ad-hoc networks. For questions about this
<BR>
special
<BR>
session, contact Ahmed Helmy (<A HREF="mailto:helmy@ceng.usc.edu?Subject=Re:%20CFP%20for%20Special%20Sessions%20in%20MMNS'2001&In-Reply-To=&lt;002101c0b833$76a372c0$05c3fe40@cti.depaul.edu&gt;">helmy@ceng.usc.edu</A>)
<BR>
<P>* RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR WIRELESS MULTIMEDIA: Broadband wireless
<BR>
multimedia services are becoming very popular. This special session will
<BR>
focus on architectures and techniques for supporting QoS Internet wireless
<BR>
multimedia. The session is looking for original contributions in this
<BR>
demanding area
<BR>
that address related issues. This includes integration of personal wireless
<BR>
multimedia into the Internet, efficient resource management techniques that
<BR>
consider the limited resources in wireless systems, such as spectrum
<BR>
resource and transmitter power, mobility management, bandwidth allocation,
<BR>
location
<BR>
and handoff procedures, channel access and assignment, call admission
<BR>
control, and end-to-end adaptive control for wireless multimedia. For
<BR>
questions about
<BR>
this special session, contact Raouf Boutaba(<A HREF="mailto:rboutaba@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca?Subject=Re:%20CFP%20for%20Special%20Sessions%20in%20MMNS'2001&In-Reply-To=&lt;002101c0b833$76a372c0$05c3fe40@cti.depaul.edu&gt;">rboutaba@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca</A>).
<BR>
<P>* MOBILE AGENT-BASED NETWORK MANAGEMENT: Research and
<BR>
development on various forms of agents and mobile agents is continuing to
<BR>
grow in a staggering fashion in recent years. Agent-based telecommunication
<BR>
applications and services such as active networks, Qos and bandwidth
<BR>
brokers, E-commerce, information gathering on Internet, and feature
<BR>
interactions are
<BR>
becoming increasingly popular and are largely contributing to the
<BR>
development and to the success of distributed multimedia  technology. This
<BR>
session will
<BR>
focus on research and development activities related to the field of agents
<BR>
in the
<BR>
area of active networks, and QoS agent-based architectures for managing
<BR>
multimedia
<BR>
networks and distributed services. The objective is to provide the audiences
<BR>
with a
<BR>
clear background into the opportunities and the challenges that the mobile
<BR>
agent
<BR>
emerging paradigm brings about For questions about this special session,
