<EM>&gt; The request comes whenever the user clicks (we're talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about user-created gaps in the stream at this point).
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh.  If the user can read a page in under 1 RTO that's a fast reader.
<BR>
So let is slow start.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We've seen traces with gaps in the 5-second range. The last ACK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes before the gap; the request arrives after the gap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this case, TCP blasts into the network - which is just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad as &quot;no slow-start&quot; - which is listed as a bug.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be a bug.  The BSD code fragments I've seen would lead me
<BR>
to think that BSD doesn't do this unless RTO was above 5 seconds for
<BR>
some reason.  By the time you have a large window you should also have
<BR>
a reasonably accurate RTO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I would like to suggest that we condsider reducing cwnd by a factor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2 for every 1/2 RTO of idle time rather than go back to a window of 1,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where idle is measured from the last segment sent.  If cwnd drops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; below ssthresh, it will quickly return to ssthresh.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are several suggestions for a solution. I prefer one that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limits the &quot;transmission rights&quot; - preventing the window from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sliding forward far enough to enable a burst of more than a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packets (4 or so).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that is overkill but if you can do this in a simple way and
<BR>
still avoid the slow start delay, that's great.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, without an implementation (which we don't have either,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but we're working on), it's premature to pick a winner.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for considering the code I posted earlier.
