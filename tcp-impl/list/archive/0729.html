<P>
Apologies for being so late with these...
<BR>
<P>-- Steve
<BR>
<P>The TCP/IP Implementor's Working Group met in Munich, on Monday, August 11th,
<BR>
at 7:30 PM.
<BR>
<P>Steve Alexander presented an overview of recent changes that have been
<BR>
made to the &quot;Known Problems&quot; I-D.  There were two, namely:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a discussion of keepalive problems was added
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the &quot;significance&quot; category now includes a description of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environments in which the problem is significant
<BR>
<P>Steve Parker then gave an overview of the current status of the &quot;Testing Tools&quot;
<BR>
I-D.  For each tool listed, the document provides information on:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- name
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- category
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- availability
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- description
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- an overview of how automated the tool is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- other references
<BR>
<P>Currently the following tools are described:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- dummynet, netperf, orchestra, packet shell, tcpanaly, tcptrace,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcplook, treno
<BR>
<P>Feedback from the audience suggested two additions:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- sock (Rich Stevens' test program); Kent Malave agreed to provide
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a description of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- SPINS, a protocol verification package
<BR>
<P>The next item on the agenda was an overview of proposed changes to RFC 2001.
<BR>
2001 is being revised to allow implementations which implement the required
<BR>
algorithms in an acceptable manner, but which may differ slightly from
<BR>
4.3-BSD-Reno to be considered conformant to RFC 2001.  At the same time, it 
<BR>
is proposed that the initial slow-start window should be increased to two
<BR>
segments.
<BR>
<P>There is an internet draft written by Floyd/Allman/Partridge, which discusses
<BR>
some additional proposed changes.  Craig Partridge gave an overview of terms:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- IW; initial congestion window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- RW; restart congestion window after idle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- LW; congestion window used after a loss
<BR>
<P>Sally Floyd indicated that more research was needed to ensure that the correct
<BR>
trade-offs are made between good scenarios and bad.
<BR>
<P>Craig Partridge asserted that no simulations done to date showed any problems
<BR>
with raising IW to two segments, but agreed that more cross-traffic simulation
<BR>
is probably a good idea.
<BR>
<P>Allyn Romanow pointed out that not all of the changes in the Floyd/Allman/
<BR>
Partridge draft were being considered for the RFC 2001 update; only increasing
<BR>
IW to two segments.
<BR>
<P>Van Jacobson gave a historical overview of the reasons for the IW being one
<BR>
segment initially, namely a very early ethernet card that could only buffer
<BR>
a single frame on receive.  Van also pointed out that dropped SYNs were a
<BR>
large problem with current web traffic.
<BR>
<P>It was pointed out that if the congestion window oscillated between one segment
<BR>
and two, that this might be less bursty than with four.
<BR>
<P>Matt Mathis pointed out that the current spec (2001) isn't completely
<BR>
up-to-date with all of the latest TCP congestion control enhancements.
<BR>
<P>Craig agreed that more simulation should be done to ensure that fairness
<BR>
issues are handled correctly.
<BR>
<P>Van pointed out that timing is really used for congestion control.  He
<BR>
explained that the RTT est. is not really used to estimate round trip time, but
<BR>
rather as a clock to determine when it is likely that a packet has left the
<BR>
network.  Van suggested that using the max rtt might be better than using the
<BR>
single RTT, which is a lower bound.
<BR>
<P>Craig Partridge volunteered to write up the RTO algorithm (Karn's) as an RFC,
<BR>
since it is not currently documented in the RFC series.
<BR>
<P>Bob Braden mentioned that the reason that a lot of Van's early work is not
<BR>
explained in RFC 1122 is that the 1122 working group didn't think that they
<BR>
could explain it as well, and that it provided an incentive to read the paper
<BR>
and get the whole story.  It was suggested that Van should convert the paper
<BR>
into an RFC; Van seemed amenable.
<BR>
<P>After the congestion control discussion ended, a list of outstanding problems
<BR>
for the &quot;Known Problems&quot; I-D was presented, and again, volunteers were
<BR>
solicited to contribute text to the I-D.
<BR>
<P>Bernard Volz mentioned a new problem, namely implementations that only send a
<BR>
FIN after all outstanding data has been ACKed; this should be added to
<BR>
the I-D.
<BR>
<P><P><P>A discussion of the IRTF End2end group's position on research vs. engineering
<BR>
was skipped.  This was because the summary had been posted to the mailing list
<BR>
but generated little interest.
<BR>
<P>The meeting then adjourned.
<BR>
<P>Action items:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Kent Malave, write up description of 'sock'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ian Heavens, write up issues around half-duplex close
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Van Jacobson, possibly write up latest SIGCOMM paper as RFC
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Craig Partridge, write I-D on Karn's algorithm
<BR>
