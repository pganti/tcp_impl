<EM>&gt; (1) Increase cwnd by 1 segment once cwnd segments are ACKed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (2) Increase cwnd by 1 segment once cwnd ACKs are received.
</EM><BR>
<P>According to 2001.bis (we just submitted version -01, so it should
<BR>
be in the archive soon), either of these are allowed.  That is, the
<BR>
spirit of the congestion avoidance algorithm is that it should
<BR>
increase cwnd by one segment per RTT.  You can do this using the
<BR>
traditional method, which is basically adding 1/cwnd for every ACK.
<BR>
This method adds about 1 segment to cwnd every RTT if delayed ACKs
<BR>
are not used and roughly 1 segment for every 2 RTTs if delayed ACKs
<BR>
are used.  Or, you can use another method (such as method (1)
<BR>
outlined above).  There are two or three methods outlined in
<BR>
2001.bis, but the basic idea is that you are allowed to somehow add
<BR>
1 segment to cwnd every RTT.
<BR>
<P>However, a TCP that is more conservative and only increases the
<BR>
window by 1 segment every other RTT is also specifically allowed by
<BR>
2001.bis (i.e., if a TCP implementer thinks any of the algorithms is
<BR>
too aggressive, throttling the window to something less than what
<BR>
the standard algorithms would use is allowed).
