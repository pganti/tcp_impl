Bill:
<BR>
<P>As someone who has frequently tried to convince people that you have useful
<BR>
things to say, I find much of your response personally offensive, but not
<BR>
the least surprising...
<BR>
<P>Just a few comments...
<BR>
<P>- I'm a bit disturbed at your reaction to &quot;not a requirement&quot;.  I thought I made
<BR>
it quite clear that I fully expect that part of the work product of this group
<BR>
will be to try and clarify items that are not currently written down but which
<BR>
ought to be &quot;requirements&quot;.  It seems that there are two classes of items
<BR>
discussed here.  Some proposals are rejected out of hand because they are not
<BR>
part of the requirements, and other things are believed to be required even
<BR>
thought they are not written down.  Isn't straightening this out a major part
<BR>
of what we are trying to do?
<BR>
<P>- Apple has announced that development of OT has been discontinued.  They will
<BR>
have to speak for themselves, but my understanding is that OT maintenance has
<BR>
not been discontinued, and you should continue to expect that problems will
<BR>
be fixed.
<BR>
<P>- A simple question on the original topic:  The PSH bit...  Assuming a non-
<BR>
broken sender TCP and a non-broken receiver TCP, then what good can be done
<BR>
by an application API to set the PSH bit?  Do I understand correctly that you
<BR>
believe that such and API is required in order to get around problems in
<BR>
broken implementations, or is there something more that you are trying to
<BR>
accomplish?
<BR>
