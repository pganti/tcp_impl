<P>First, let me define NewReno for the purpose of this discussion.  NewReno is 
<BR>
Reno with the following changes:
<BR>
i) define a variable (snd_recover) that is set to snd_max upon entering fast
<BR>
recovery.  When snd_una reaches snd_recover, the fast recovery phase is 
<BR>
considered to be over.
<BR>
ii) if a partial cumulative ack is received (ti_ack &lt; snd_recover), retransmit
<BR>
the next segment beyond ti_ack, deflate snd_cwnd by the amount of new
<BR>
data acknowledged, add back one segment to snd_cwnd, and send a new segment
<BR>
if permitted.
<BR>
iii) if a new ack is received with (ti_ack &gt;= snd_recover), set snd_cwnd to
<BR>
min(snd_ssthresh, amount of outstanding data in the network + 1 segment)
<BR>
and otherwise exit fast recovery as in Reno.
<BR>
iv) do not reset snd_recover upon a rtx timeout.  If three dupacks are received 
<BR>
and (ti_ack &lt; snd_recover), do not perform fast retransmit/fast recovery but 
<BR>
instead just advance snd_cwnd by one segment and send the next segment 
<BR>
(snd_nxt).  This is avoidance of false fast retransmission after a timeout.
<BR>
<P>When combining SACK with NewReno, the SACK information may permit you to
<BR>
identify segments that need to be retransmitted before you receive the 
<BR>
partial cumulative ack.  In our implementation, if the SACK information 
<BR>
indicates that the receiver is holding a segment sent at least 3 segments 
<BR>
beyond a given segment that is not SACKed, the given segment is eligible for 
<BR>
retransmission.  If we send such a retransmission ``early'' (i.e., before 
<BR>
partial cumulative ack), we decrement the inflated snd_cwnd by one segment to 
<BR>
account for this (in essence, we trade sending a new segment
<BR>
off the top of the window for the early retransmission).  If we later get a 
<BR>
partial cumulative ack, but the next segment has already been retransmitted,
<BR>
snd_cwnd is inflated by one segment.  In summary, in our implementation, SACK 
<BR>
information permits the substitution of an early retransmission for inflating 
<BR>
snd_cwnd by one segment, in a manner consistent with the allowable amount
<BR>
of outstanding data in the network under NewReno rules.  This reordering of
<BR>
retransmissions and new transmissions allows recovery to occur in fewer RTTs.
<BR>
<P>SACK with Reno also allows you to send retransmissions early (as defined 
<BR>
above), but suffers from the multiple window reductions in one window of data
<BR>
and false fast retransmission problems.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>p.s.  I'd like to hear if my outline of what I called NewReno above is 
<BR>
consistent with the ``bug fix'' people had in mind, as I know the term 
<BR>
NewReno can mean different things to different people.
