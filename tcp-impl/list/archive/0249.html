Bill:
<BR>
<P>The easiest way to discover whether or not an implementation uses delayed
<BR>
ACKs is to exchange one byte messages between applications.  If you see
<BR>
two packets per exchange, then ACKs are being deferred.  If you see four
<BR>
packets per exchange, then either ACKs are not being deferred, or possibly
<BR>
the deferred ACK interval is so small that the applications can not turn
<BR>
around a single byte in the interval.  Had you tried this, you would have seen
<BR>
that we do indeed defer ACKs.  When you look at a single data packet that
<BR>
follows an ACK, all you have &quot;discovered&quot; is that the application got the data
<BR>
out too late to piggyback on the ACK.  This can obviously happen regardless
<BR>
of the deferred ACK interval.
<BR>
<P>The default deferred ACK interval in our implementation is 50ms.  The value is
<BR>
tunable by vendors, and, in most cases, by the end user.  Where 50ms is less
<BR>
than a tick (which is not the case in any of our production versions), you
<BR>
are correct that the default should be larger.  In the case of the Mac, I
<BR>
believe that a tick is 10ms, but I know that it is substantially smaller than
<BR>
50ms.  Apple does not provide the ability for tuning by end-users in OT 1.1.1.
<BR>
<P>I'm more than happy to listen to comments from the group on what the default
<BR>
deferred ACK interval ought to be.
