</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There is a lot of empirical evidence that indicates IW=2 works.   There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; also does not seem to be evidence that IW=2 is a bad thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk?Subject=Re:%20what%20IW%20is%20being%20used%20today?&In-Reply-To=&lt;6596.wsimpson@greendragon.com&gt;">alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk</A> (Alan Cox)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know only one verified example - the 9600 baud half duplex radio link here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On that IW=2 sucks badly (but in general stuff sucks pretty badly over it).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've not found anything else it made worse (28.8,14.4 modem, 64K circuits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and ethernet)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I have had similar experience to Alan at 9600 (and slower).  There is
<BR>
still a fair amount of that around here.  Merit just upgraded the 2400
<BR>
only last year -- I expect it will be awhile until all the 9600 will be
<BR>
replaced.
<BR>
<P>I have seen IW=2 work badly on 28.8 when talking to SunOS (with POP3).
<BR>
<P>I consistently get a retransmit on the 4th (and sometimes 3rd) packet
<BR>
coming back, which is probably the window opening just enough to send 4
<BR>
datagrams in response to my 1 plus Syn, and then timing out when the
<BR>
Acks are not fast enough.  I don't have a trace on both ends, so this is
<BR>
guesswork.
<BR>
<P>And there is a lot of SunOS still out there.  Folks don't upgrade (at
<BR>
Sun upgrade prices).  And look at how much W3.1 is still around at
<BR>
cheaper M$ upgrade prices!
<BR>
<P>So, I'm more in favor of recommending no delay on the first Ack after
<BR>
Syn+Ack, rather than IW=2.
<BR>
<P>How about _MUST_ no delay first Ack after idle, and _MAY_ IW=RW=2?
<BR>
<P>That will handle performance for new/upgraded systems, while not
<BR>
harming traffic with old ones unless deliberately configured.
