Jeremy:
<BR>
<P>-&gt; &gt;   Machine A initiates a connection to machine B.
<BR>
-&gt; &gt;   A sends a segment with ISN x, chosen according
<BR>
-&gt; &gt;   A's clock, and with SYN bit set to 1, this is the
<BR>
-&gt; &gt;   connection request message.
<BR>
-&gt; &gt; 	- the ACK flag is set to 0
<BR>
-&gt; &gt; 	- this segment is still a regular TCP segment; it
<BR>
-&gt; &gt; 	  can carry data too (piggyback 1)
<BR>
-&gt; 
<BR>
-&gt; I have implemented this; it works nicely.   However, the question
<BR>
-&gt; arises: how much data may be piggybacked on a SYN?  What window may
<BR>
-&gt; the sender assume?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually there are more interoperability issues here. An intelligent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP implementation can make an educated guess. In other words,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Include as much data application gives in the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first connect request message
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If it didn't get through, then in subsequent re-tries
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either don't include any data or include less data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(with exponential back off with limited tries is one solution)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because, in order to interoperate with different TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations. Other end has either:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- no support of piggyback data reception support, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- short of window (you don't know)
<BR>
<P>-&gt; &gt;       - however, if it does contain data, machine B
<BR>
-&gt; &gt;         cannot deliver the data to application until the
<BR>
-&gt; &gt;         connection is successfully established
<BR>
-&gt; 
<BR>
-&gt; As a nonstandard extension to TCP, I propose that this restriction
<BR>
-&gt; can be relaxed in certain situations:
<BR>
-&gt; 
<BR>
-&gt; IF
<BR>
-&gt; - The TCP and next layer up (&quot;ULP&quot;) are tightly-coupled 
<BR>
-&gt; (e.g. both in the
<BR>
-&gt;   kernel) and have a rich interface
<BR>
-&gt; - The ULP data consists of a request which
<BR>
-&gt; 	- does not require much processing
<BR>
-&gt; 	- does not modify any server state (bar stats counters, cache
<BR>
-&gt; 	  state etc)
<BR>
-&gt;   ( thus making the &quot;at-most-once&quot; property of TCP unneeded )
<BR>
-&gt; - The receiver system can adequately defend itself against DOS attack
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, TCP should track type of applications (actually
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connections). TCP should know before hand that - when it receives
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data with a connect request, it SHOULD give only if the application
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has all the above requirements/constraints.
<BR>
<P>-&gt; I believe that an HTTP GET which hits an in-kernel cache 
<BR>
-&gt; satisfies the
<BR>
-&gt; above constraints; the transaction can then be reduced to a 
<BR>
-&gt; minimum of three packets.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! I agree... this is a very good optimization for some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications
