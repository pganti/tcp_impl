&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; question.  He further noted that MTU discovery should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; done without ICMP due to security concerns (and, noted that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; this might fall under ``security problems'' rather than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; ``serious problems'').  Matt [Mathis] suggested that we note the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; problem and state that we do not yet know how to solve it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; Ran Atkinson suggested that MTU discovery is not a security
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; problem as a host must be continuously jammed with ``too
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark&gt; small'' ICMP messages for an attack to be successful.  Matt
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a couple of comments about this.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to refute Ran's claim --- it is entirely correct. The
<BR>
question is what is the impact of it? 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume a TCP connection that traverses a network, and is carried
<BR>
with IPsec (perhaps just AH) in &quot;transport&quot; mode. If there is some
<BR>
reason to believe that AH (or ESP) is on that network path, then 
<BR>
I would suggest that is sufficient worry about attacks or flooding
<BR>
with ICMP. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;IPsec AH around a TCP makes a lot of sense: it eliminates
<BR>
practically all the TCP based attacks, and converts the SYN flooding
<BR>
problem to an ISAKMP SA flooding problem. ISAKMP was designed from the
<BR>
beginning to deal with this. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for ICMP packets. &quot;port unreachable&quot; would originate from the
<BR>
destination host, which could conceivably transit with IPsec
<BR>
protection, but all other useful ICMP packets relevant to TCP originate
<BR>
from intermediate hosts/routers: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- dest unreachable (Frag Needed is the one for PMTU, but the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others are also very important)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- source quench  (I'm told that few this is seldom used at present)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- redirect       (really an IP level info, but it affects TCP)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- time exceeded  (I think that TCP doesn't do anything with this)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;[are there others I've missed?]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;What can a &quot;secured&quot; TCP connection ignore, and with what effect?
<BR>
<P>1. unreach/net unreach   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unreach/host unreach 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unreach/prot unreach 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unreach/port unreach 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ignore these, then we retransmit a lot, and finally, after a
<BR>
long time, we give up. If this is the SYN packet, then no data flows.
<BR>
If this is after the SYN packet (a node goes down), then the
<BR>
connection just hangs, eventually timing out and exiting. If the node
<BR>
comes back up again (without its IPSEC SA's), then the corresponding
<BR>
node will get an ISAKMP &quot;Initial Contact&quot; message from the node that
<BR>
rebooted when the corresponding node sends another packet.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One hopes eventually ISAKMP will be smart enough not to create a 
<BR>
new IPsec SA, so that the two nodes can send enough TCP RSTs!
<BR>
<P>2. source quench
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ignore these, then we may get very poor performance when the
<BR>
router queues fill up. However, there are better, in-protocol ways
<BR>
to detect congestion and deal with it. Case closed IMHO.
<BR>
<P>3. redirect
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not exclusively a TCP issue, but an IP one. In general, they
<BR>
can't be trusted, so we have to ignore them. This means that packets
<BR>
are not routed as efficiently as they might. Are there other
<BR>
repercussions of ignoring them?
<BR>
<P>4. unreach/need fragment
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ignore this one, and we are setting the DF bit, we get no
<BR>
service. This is serious. If we disable PMTU for IPsec protected 
<BR>
TCP sessions, then, with IPv4, we simply get inefficient TCP. On very
<BR>
lossy links, however, that may result in no useful throughput. (And I
<BR>
suspect that these kinds of links may become more and more common)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On IPv6, we get no service, since DF is implicitely set.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[I should note that there are some heuristics that might be used
<BR>
that are equivalent to &quot;ignore ICMP&quot;, but do gain some information
<BR>
from it.]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote a draft on how to do PMTU with ICMPs from the *receiving*
<BR>
node. It should work with IPv4 easily. I have some ideas, and have
<BR>
read some other ideas on how to adapt this for IPv6. (The problem is
<BR>
essentially equivalent to the MTU Black Hole problem).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to second Matt's suggestion. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would further ask the question: does IPsec make all third party
<BR>
ICMP's obsolete? Does IPv6 add useful new ones? Or problematic new
<BR>
ones?
