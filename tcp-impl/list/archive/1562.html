<EM>&gt; 	HTTP REQ 1	--&gt;	
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 			&lt;--	1st segment of RES 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	HTTP REQ 2	--&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 			&lt;--    last 1.25 segment of RES 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 			&lt;--	0.25 segment RES 2 delayed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If httpd had seen REQ 2, then i think it should have done one send which had 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 1.25 RES 1 and the 0.25 RES 2.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is urging that applications be smart enough to see REQ2 before
<BR>
finishing sending RES1?  It's nice to gobble all currently waiting input
<BR>
before sending your output, but I think it's above and beyond the call of
<BR>
duty, and edges into geewhiz freaping creaturism territory.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If httpd had not seen REQ 2, then you are right, the 0.25 RES 2 will be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delayed.
</EM><BR>
<P>With all current and proposed forms of Nagle, right?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Notice, however, that if you were using something like SO_EXPLICITPUSH, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you set SO_EXPLICITPUSH for the 1.25 RES 1, and then turned around and set 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SO_EXPLICITPUSH for the 0.25 RES 2, *my* [fictional] implementation would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *also* delay the 0.25 RES 2.  (This is because i would be using 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SO_EXPLICITPUSH as a way to *avoid* sending &lt; MSS packets, but would *still* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be protecting the network from excess traffic from small packets.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That is inconsistent with my understanding of Dave Borman's SO_EXPFLUSH
<BR>
bit.  (PLEASE call it something other than SO_EXPLICITPUSH, because it
<BR>
has nothing to do with the other PSH thing!)   As I understood it, his
<BR>
bit would flush data no matter how small.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Having an adaptive delayed ack scheme is an interesting idea (that others, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including John Nagle recently, have thought about).  I don't know if it would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be based on link speed, &quot;one-way-ness&quot; of application traffic, or what.  It is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; independent of the Nagle modification.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and everyone who thinks about a timer immediately looks for something
<BR>
else, something practical.  It's not as if we don't already know how hard
<BR>
adaptive timers are, from experience with congestion stuff (even if you're
<BR>
not impressed by the high costs that such timers impose on large systems).
<BR>
There are unrelated, very good reasons for an adapative delayed Ack timer
<BR>
on any shared medium LAN.  When you're pushing lots of data, the reverse
<BR>
stream of TCP ACK's does terrible things to performance.  For example, on
<BR>
BLEB 802.3, reducing the Ack rate can be good for a 30% throughput boost.
<BR>
But ...

<BR>
Such words migth be ok in an RFC that is justified on other grounds,
<BR>
although they seem to me to duplicate RFC 896.  However, I strongly oppose
<BR>
a purely conscousness raising RFC.  You don't need to get the word out to
<BR>
people who woud read a new RFC, since they've already RFC 896 and RFC
<BR>
1122.  Publishing broadsides is statisfying to the already enlightened,
<BR>
but as we know from watching real life, doesn't do much to raise the
<BR>
conscousness of those who actually need it.
<BR>
<P>Has everyone who favors a conscousness raising RFC read RFC 896 and the
<BR>
relevant parts of RFC 1122?  More words can be less when it comes to
<BR>
raising consciousness.
