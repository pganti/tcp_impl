||research issues from the perspective of the tcp-impl WG.  The issues I've
<BR>
||noted so far are:
<BR>
||
<BR>
I'm not sure if your list implies window scaling, SACK and fast recovery
<BR>
but it seems to me that they should get added to the MUST list as we go
<BR>
forward.  I know its not research at this point but...
<BR>
<P>I suspect an item indicating our discussion, and later dissassociation with
<BR>
the SYN attack is also in order so it doesn't come up again :-).
<BR>
<P>I've heard from parties involved with other TCP's than ours as well as
<BR>
from board vendors the desire to reduce the ACK stream on &quot;highly reliable
<BR>
LAN&quot;'s.  The thought here (which I personally disagree with) is that on
<BR>
a high speed LAN, say 100-Meg Ether or FDDI, the 1 ACK per 2 data packets
<BR>
exchange unecessarily clutters the LAN and that somehow backing off the
<BR>
ACK policy to 1 ACK per 4 packets, 
<BR>
1 ACK per window size/packetsize-some constant
<BR>
will lead to less small apckets on the wire, leads to less host processing,
<BR>
leads to better LAN utilization/more cycles for the CPU, etc.
<BR>
<P>The way it has been explained to me - reducing the ACK frequency can yield
<BR>
up to 20% performance improvement over a LAN/decrease collisions on a LAN,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>It personally bothers me that something like this could possibly be
<BR>
deployed without serious research cycles invested by non-commercial
<BR>
parties.
<BR>
<P>L.
