<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;[I'm hesitant about continuing to post this to both lists, but I'm
<BR>
not sure where else it should go. I know that it doesn't really fit
<BR>
into either charter, since we aren't documenting TCP bugs that need
<BR>
fixing, and aren't discussing the things that we REALLY need to finish
<BR>
to terminate the IPsec group. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please give me advice by private email. Maybe I should write this up
<BR>
as a draft, since I can see it getting more fleshed out in my mind.]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; What is this &quot;other end&quot;?  If talking to the other end of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; a TCP connection were enough, then the MSS negotiation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; would be enough and the Path MTU Discovery mechanism would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; not be needed.  In fact, the MSS negotiation is often not
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assuming that packets that are sent that are too big, or become
<BR>
too big due to n-levels of ESP/AH transport/tunnels will be
<BR>
fragmented if the DF bit is not set.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How much the packet gets fragmented can be determined by the
<BR>
receiving host and/or tunnel end-point: it can observe the largest
<BR>
fragment that was successfully received and participated in
<BR>
reassembly. This information can be relayed to the sending host via an
<BR>
ICMP Datagram Too Big message that can be put into the tunnel.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This appears to screwed up by multiple paths with different
<BR>
MTUs. However, it is easily fixed by only taking PMTU information from
<BR>
packets that were fragmented: a larger packet that arrives intact
<BR>
clearly took a different route, so it doesn't matter. Eventually, if 
<BR>
the correspondant nodes can adjust their PMTU appropriately, all
<BR>
packets arrive unfragmented. Clearly, the rate that ICMP's are sent
<BR>
needs to be limited to not more than one per RTT.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This works well on the end system that reassembles the packets. So,
<BR>
getting an estimate of the PMTU from a transport mode, or tunnel mode
<BR>
terminating on the end node is easy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the tunnel doesn't terminate on the end node (but on a security
<BR>
gateway), then one observes that the gateway must reassemble the ESP
<BR>
or AH packets to terminate the tunnel. The gateway node can there 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) send an ICMP (in transport? or tunnel?) to the originating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gateway, informing it of the PMTU that it sees, and the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originating gateway will send an ICMP to nodes that set the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DF bit when they do normal PMTU.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) alternatively, the PMTU between gateways could be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communicated with an ISAKMP message.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) send an ICMP through the tunnel, to the TCP originating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(TLO in the terminology of my traversal draft) node. The TLO
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sees this packet just like it would when it got ICMP messages
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when security wasn't present. However, it never sees the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;routes that were tunnelled through, but the far end tunnel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point would collect all that info for it anyway.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW: not all current IPsec implementations do the right thing with
<BR>
the DF flag. In theory, a DF flag on a packet going into a tunnel
<BR>
should cause the tunnel wrapper to have the DF bit set, and the ICMP
<BR>
Datagram Too Big messages adjusted in size and passed back to the
<BR>
originating host. This assumes we can trust them. At least one
<BR>
implementation in Detroit dropped the packets immediately, since the
<BR>
new packet size didn't fit the outgoing interface's MTU, so the ICMP
<BR>
would have been trusted in that case. My recommendation is to never
<BR>
set the DF bit on the outside packet until you can deal with the
<BR>
ICMP. That is, the problem is punted for a future working group, but
<BR>
it means that IPsec VPN tunnels become non-compliant routers since
<BR>
they don't honour the DF bit.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; The trouble with authenticating path MTU information
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; (regardless of its form) is key distribution.  How would
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;My position is that you can't distribute the keys. Please see my
<BR>
draft for another place where it appears the intermediate security
<BR>
gateways need the keys.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; The only response to worries about path MTU messages, as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; well as source quences, port, net, and host Unreachables,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; and many other such indications is to be to cross your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; fingers and ignore any that would have serious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; consequences, such as an message telling you to use an MTU
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; of 68.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can do better than that.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;&gt; ...  I can't think of many cases in the current deployed
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; internet where the MTU might change during a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; connection. Usually, the smallest MTU is on the edges at that
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; 28.8 (or that 2400 baud modem) link, and that isn't likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; change suddendly. I can see mobileip possibly changing
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; this. If/when mobileip is deployed en-mass, it will definitely
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; include IPsec.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; There is a vast amount of topology on the edges, what with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; ATM (9180), FDDI (4352), Ethernet (1500 or 1492), PPP (256
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; to more than 1500), and Frame Relay.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But, do any of these things *change* during the course of a TCP
<BR>
connection?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the routing on the backbone might change, my guess is that the
<BR>
MTU between backbone nodes is almost always going to be more than the
<BR>
1500 typical of a T1. I guess, two networks, that do ATM with their
<BR>
supplier could get a much lower MTU if the supplier's ATM backbone
<BR>
goes down, and the move their backup T1s. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; Besides, if you stay away from the edges and in the center
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; where routes don't flap among links with different MTU's,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; you may as well fix your MTU=1500 and forget Path MTU
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; discover.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is this option.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;&gt; Getting Path MTU information back to the sending TCP is not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; unsurmountable challenge to VPN uses of IPsec, but it isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;&gt; easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; On the contrary, I think the key distribution problem is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; insurmountable and makes authenticated path MTU
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernon&gt; information impossible.  For example, look at any real
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree: trying to get the ICMP Datagram Too Big messages
<BR>
authenticated is not possible. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't agree that getting authenticated PMTU information is
<BR>
impossible.
