<EM>&gt; &gt;       From the client stack side, the connection no longer exists

<EM>&gt; &gt; 3S Server continues to be in a write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Server Stack goes to CLOSE_WAIT ( having received the FIN )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 4S Server will continue to write to the client, until it has exhausted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    its window. This is OK for a half-close.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 5S The window is exhausted, and the server will wait until the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    opens the window. (window probes )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To be perfectly precise, the server won't &quot;wait&quot;; it should send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; periodic probes. So in this case the server is still sending TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segments.  If it really is waiting for the client to send it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something, the server stack is broken.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we are using confusing nomenclature here.  The server HTTPD
<BR>
process waits but the server TCP/IP continues to probe, is that it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 4C. The client should, but doesnt  send a RST upon receiving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        remaining data from the server or window probes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The client is clearly broken, and in a major way that just doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make sense to me. In step 3C, the client has destroyed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection. Yet in step 4C, when the client gets a TCP segment for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which it doesn't have a control block, it does nothing, as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sending a RST.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the client application has destroyed the _socket_; isn't the
<BR>
connection still there, in FIN_WAIT_2, happily sending zero windows
<BR>
in response to the server probes?
<BR>
<P>I would really like to see the network trace for this...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The client stack needs to be fixed; the fix is to follow the TCP spec,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; which has nothing to do with whether it issued a half-duplex close or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not.  Just what stack has this property, i.e., doesn't send RSTs when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receiving a TCP segment for which it has no associated connection?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is majorly broken.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, I can't imagine anyone getting away with this...if you opened a 
<BR>
connection to a port for which there was no listener, it would continue
<BR>
trying until it timed out rather than returning with ECONNREFUSED.
