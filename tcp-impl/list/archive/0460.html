<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:touch@ISI.EDU?Subject=Re:%20TIME-WAIT%20truncation&In-Reply-To=&lt;199706052150.PAA06270@mica.denver.sgi.com&gt;">touch@ISI.EDU</A>
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The justification for this was that if someone was launching a Denial of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Service attack on your machine, picking a slot at random was most likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to pick one that was opened as part of the attack.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only way to avoid SYN flooding is to deny the connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempts, which will happen anyway once the TCB memory space is full.
</EM><BR>
<P>SYN attacks do not involve TIME_WAIT.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Denying the connection attempts&quot; is a poor defense against a denial of
<BR>
service attack such as SYN bombing, since causing you to deny
<BR>
connection attemptss is the purpose for the SYM bombing.
<BR>
<P>Have you estimated how big your listen queue would need to be at either
<BR>
75 or 180 seconds (common listen queue timeouts) if you were being SYN
<BR>
bombed at T1 or T3 rates, and were not denying any legitimate connections?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The better (and TCP friendly) solution is to queue incoming SYN requests,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and pick one randomly when a slot opens. This prevents the attacker
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from timing the incoming SYNs to grab TCBs as they get freed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Pick one what when a slot opens, a slot or an incoming SYN request?
<BR>
Under which circumstances when a slot opens should do that picking?
<BR>
After you've picked whichever it is, what do you do with it?  If it is
<BR>
a SYN request, then you must discard it, which is what you'd do without
<BR>
any picking when your listen queue is full, and is a bad idea since it
<BR>
is what the attacker wants.  If it is a slot, then you are doing one of
<BR>
the two forms of the second half of the standard SYN bomb defense.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; That would satisfy CERT, too, I presume (someone should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check, though I suspect they'd look to us for verification anyway).
</EM><BR>
<P>The SYN bombing issue is long over and solved, essentially
<BR>
independently of CERT, and certainly independently of any verifying by
<BR>
you or ISI.
<BR>
<P><P>The solution to SYN bombing is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- use as large a listen queue as you can afford, and try to make
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cost of each slot on the listen queue small and searching a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;big queue fast so you can afford more.  At least 30K slots is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one recommendation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- drop either the oldest or a random, pre-existing entry in your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen queue when it is full and a new SYN arrives.
<BR>
<P><P>Again, this has little if anything to do with TIME_WAIT.
