<P>
The new draft incorporates the following changes of substance:
<BR>
<P>* 'dbs' tool is added.  This tool, by Yukio Murayama which is something
<BR>
like a 'ttcp' except it orchestrates multiple transfers between N hosts
<BR>
driven by a script file.  See <A HREF="http://www.ai3.net/products/dbs">http://www.ai3.net/products/dbs</A>.
<BR>
<P>* In an attempt to clarify the scope of the document I've added to the
<BR>
introduction:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document lists only tools which can evaluate one or more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations, and which can provide some specific results
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which describe or evalute the TCP being tested.
<BR>
<P>(Wordsmithing suggestions here are welcome.)
<BR>
<P>This was motivated by evaluating SPIN and Richard Stevens' sock program
<BR>
for inclusion.  I felt neither should be included, and here's why.
<BR>
<P>SPIN cannot operate on an implementation.  Although a very cool tool, it
<BR>
requires you transliterate the protocol machine into the validation
<BR>
language.  At this point you are no longer testing the implementation
<BR>
but an interpretation of it.
<BR>
<P>The sock program was nominated, basically, because it has lots of knobs,
<BR>
some of which affect the TCP behavior.  However, I felt since sock had
<BR>
little if any way to detect whether the TCP beneath it actually behaved
<BR>
in any particular way, it wasn't per se much of TCP test tool.  The value
<BR>
(I gather from other members of the group who expressed interest in
<BR>
listing 'sock') is mainly that it allows you to twiddle lots of controls
<BR>
at the socket level.  You still have to sit there with at least a snooping
<BR>
tool to tell anything.
<BR>
<P>(And I suppose while we're at it, I've left out snooping tools because I
<BR>
consider them too obvious, and because they are strictly passive not much
<BR>
of a test either.)
<BR>
<P>So this message by way of soliciting any final comment before I rev the
<BR>
draft later this week.  Although I've made some comments to the list
<BR>
about the above, this is a summary of all but typographic changes.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
