<P>
All you said Marcel is correct, the problem is one a loss appears at the
<BR>
end of the window (before the end by less than three packets) and you
<BR>
don't send enough new segments during Fast Recovery to make dupacks more
<BR>
than 3. Take this counterexemple
<BR>
<P>If the source transmits packets 
<BR>
<P>[1] 2 3 [4] 5
<BR>
<P>I use the same notation for lost packets. The source receives first
<BR>
three dup acks that correspond to the receipt of packets 2, 3 and 5.
<BR>
dupacks is then 3 and the source retransmits packet 1, sets its window
<BR>
to 2 and adds three to cwnd which becomes 5. Here no new segments are
<BR>
transmitted. When packet 1 arrives at the destination, an ack asking for
<BR>
packet 4 is transmitted. According to your proposal, when the source
<BR>
receives this ACK, it decrements dupacks by two which becomes 1. Here
<BR>
packets 4 cannot be retransmitted and a timeout is required. However
<BR>
with the current version of New Reno it is retransmitted directly. I
<BR>
think that it must be retransmitted because one Round trip time has
<BR>
passed since its transmission and it is very probable that it is lost.
<BR>
<P>Now for my proposal about stretching the Fast Recovery phase, I don't
<BR>
mean by stretching try to recover the new packets sent during the Fast
<BR>
Recovery phase without reducing further the window, I just want to
<BR>
profit from the information that these packets are sent long time ago
<BR>
(at least one Round trip time). As in current New Reno Fast Recovery
<BR>
must always end when all the packets in the window when it is called are
<BR>
acknowledged. Any loss in another round trip time is another congestion
<BR>
signal and the window must be reduced again. 
<BR>
<P>Let X and Y the lowest and the highest sequence numbers transmitted when
<BR>
Fast Recovery is called. X is lost. 
<BR>
<P>Let Z be the highest sequence number between X and Y that is also lost.
<BR>
When the source receives the partial ACK asking for packet Z, it has
<BR>
transmitted new packets until T whith T&gt;Y. 
<BR>
Here it retransmits Z and may be some new packets beyond T. Packet Z
<BR>
arrives at the destination which must ack all the packets till T if they
<BR>
are correctly received of course. Suppose that a packet between Y and T
<BR>
is also lost, call it U, we have the following figure
<BR>
<P>X  [Z]  Y  [U]  T    
<BR>
<P>Here the source receives an ACK asking for packet U. If it resets the
<BR>
dupacks counter after leaving fast recovery and if the number of
<BR>
segments sent after T is less than three, the detection of the loss of U
<BR>
requires a timeout. Recall that all the dupack of segments X till T have
<BR>
been already received when the ack asking for segment U arrived. However
<BR>
if the source uses the dupack counter as proposed by Marcel, it will
<BR>
consider the dup acks of packets sent between U and T with any dup ack
<BR>
for a packet sent after T. This may also cause a failure of Fast
<BR>
Retransmit if the number of these dup acks is less than three. However
<BR>
this proposition is better than resetting the counter because it takes
<BR>
account of dup acks for packets between U and T.
<BR>
<P>I propose here that the source should retransmit directly packet U
<BR>
without waiting for three dupack or timeout. At least one round trip
<BR>
time has passed since the transmission of U and it is very probable that
<BR>
it is lost. How to do this??
<BR>
<P>The source stores in a variable the highest sequence number sent and it
<BR>
updates this variable when it receives a partial ACK (less than Y). When
<BR>
it leaves Fast Recovery and receives an ACK asking for a packet less
<BR>
than this variable (T in our exemple), it retransmits this packet
<BR>
directly.
<BR>
<P>What do you think?
