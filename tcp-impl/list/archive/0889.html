<P>
<EM>&gt;Both the BSD and the NT behavior are fine as long as they're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mixed.  However, when trying to talk from a BSD-derived box to an NT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;box, serious performance problems may occur if the BSD box gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unlucky and happens to reuse a port number within the TIME_WAIT period
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the NT box.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unix utilities like rsh relies on the BSD behavior to work in UNIX &lt;-&gt;
<BR>
UNIX communication. So it's not just being unlucky, i.e. this case
<BR>
happens all the time in Solaris when one logout and rlogin back in
<BR>
the same machine within 2MSL time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The HP, receiving an ACK, sends a RST.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	it is the HP's responsibility not to reuse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	the port numbers for 2*MSL from this time
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, i don't think this is described in any TCP specs, or is commonly
<BR>
implemented, although it seems like one way of fixing the TWA hazard
<BR>
below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The NT receives the RST, goes to LISTEN and deletes the TCB, and returns.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the typical TIME-WAIT assassination hazard. See rfc1337. An easy
<BR>
fix is to not truncate the TIME-WAIT TCB.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Oops, I think I misinterpreted my trace as far as what happens after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;HP sent the RST.  In the trace, the second connection goes through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after roughly 3 seconds.  I first assumed that this was due to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(mis-)configured NT box with 2*MSL=3 seconds.  However, looking at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trace more carefully, I found that the first retransmission of the SYN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the second connection succeeds, so it may indeed be that NT had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deleted the TCB in response to HP's RST.
</EM><BR>
<P>So this is strictly a performance concern, not a violation of the spec
<BR>
(except the TWA hazard, which I wonder if anyone is actively addressing).
<BR>
We've had a slightly different problem that went on un-noticed in this
<BR>
area for months because it only happened when one rlogin back to the
<BR>
same machine. The additional 3sec was taken as sluggish machine...
