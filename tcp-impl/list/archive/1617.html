Hello, 
<BR>
<P>I am interested in my current work in the slow start phase of TCP. It is
<BR>
clear that this algorithm is necessary to increase gradually the
<BR>
congestion window so that to not overwhelm the network buffers and to
<BR>
activate smoothly the ACK clock. At the beginning of the connection, it
<BR>
serves also to estimate the available capacity of the network. 
<BR>
But such slow increase deteriorates the performance of the protocol when
<BR>
long delay paths such as satellite links are crossed by the connection.
<BR>
Large initial window avoids some Round Trips at the beginning of the
<BR>
connection but it may result in losses because this initial window is
<BR>
transmitted in a burst. I think that the appropriate solution to this
<BR>
problem is a kind of available bandwidth estimation. However, estimating
<BR>
the available bandwidth is difficult to be implemented. I am
<BR>
investigating another solution which lets TCP send many packets at the
<BR>
beginning of the connection but not in a bursty manner as with large
<BR>
initial window.
<BR>
<P>A timer of value smaller than timeout (saying 50ms or 100ms) is set when
<BR>
the first packet is sent. This timer is canceled when an ACK is
<BR>
received. If the timer expires, this means that an ACK has not been
<BR>
received. The source supposes here that a long delay path has been
<BR>
crossed by the connection and therefore it transmits a new packet and
<BR>
sets again the timer. The absence of an ACK may be due to the loss of
<BR>
the first packet. This loss is still detected via timeout.  
<BR>
This timer is set in the first Round Trip Time at the beginning of the
<BR>
connection. We can set it also whenever a timeout occurs. Once we
<BR>
receive an ACK, a normal slow start is done. The window is increased by
<BR>
one MSS for every new ACK.
<BR>
<P>This solution results in many packets transmitted at the beginning of
<BR>
the connection (proportional to RTT) but spaced so that to not overload
<BR>
the network. It functions only in case of long delay paths. With small
<BR>
RTTs, an ACK is received before the expiration of the added timer and a
<BR>
single packet is thus transmitted in the first RTT (the delayed ACK at
<BR>
the receiver may affect this behavior). I think that spreading out the
<BR>
first packets sent during slow start may result in separate bursts
<BR>
during the subsequent RTTs. It is known that bursts sent during slow
<BR>
start overload the network buffers due to their high rate. Reducing the
<BR>
size of these bursts may avoid some losses. 
<BR>
<P>The idea is at the beginning, I don't know exactly what will be its
<BR>
negative effect on TCP and on the network. Also, the overload it causes 
<BR>
to the operating system must be investigated. Any feedback on this issue
<BR>
will be very appreciated. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance 
<BR>
