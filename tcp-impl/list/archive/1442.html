<P><EM>&gt; &gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As far as I can see, there would be no problem (other than cost) with what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft is alledged to be doing if they guarantee that all initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sequence numbers are &quot;sufficently far apart.&quot;   &quot;Smaller&quot; is as good as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;larger&quot;, provided the delta is large enough so the probability of
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, I wouldn't say &quot;no problem&quot;.  What I see at issue is that many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP implementations (such as BSD) will allow a connection in TIME-WAIT to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be reused before the TIME-WAIT has expired, if the incoming SYN has an ISS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is greater than the FIN from the previous instance of the connection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Otherwise, since there is no ACK bit, the SYN and any retranmissions of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SYN will be silently dropped until the TIME-WAIT state expires.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, for a TCP that generates random ISS values, when quickly re-using a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP connection, they are going to have a 50/50 chance of the connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either being quickly established, or hung up doing SYN retransmissions until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the TIME-WAIT connection on the server goes away or the client gives up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its SYN retransmissions.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a good point.
<BR>
<P>What is the political odor of that BSD feature in the IETF today?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Of course, one problem is that since most TCPs destroy the PCB after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting the FIN in LAST-ACK state, if they immediatly reuse the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection they have no idea what the last sequence number used was.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the new ISS is just the standard ISS increment, and if the previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection transfered more data than the delta between the ISSs, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ISS on the new SYN won't pass the TIME-WAIT check...
</EM><BR>
<P>Both this problem and your other point apply only if the same
<BR>
(addr,port,addr,port) 4-tuple is used, right?
<BR>
<P>In both problems, isn't the worst case a TIME-WAIT delay, and not the data
<BR>
corruption of the likely implementation of the alledged random Microsoft
<BR>
ISS's?   Of course, over the years we've each heard vastly more complaints
<BR>
about TIME-WAIT delays than about data corruption, and never mind validity.
<BR>
<P><P>How likely is the re-use of a 4-tuple today?  In ancient days, wasn't it
<BR>
fairly unlikely because hosts had enough state to keep the client end of
<BR>
a connection in TIME-WAIT?  Reboot-every-few-minutes DOS hurt that
<BR>
protection, but current Microsoft systems don't like unscheduled rebooting
<BR>
and simply don't reboot quickly.  (A 300 MHz PII WIN95 w/fast disks of my
<BR>
acquantance wants about 100 seconds if it doesn't insist on running chkdisk,
<BR>
and lots more if it does.  Don't ask about the agility of the 33 MHz 486
<BR>
NT system I use.  Redhat 5.2 Linux is worse.)  On the fifth hand, dynamic
<BR>
PPP IP addresses could mean that some 4-tuples are rather popular.
