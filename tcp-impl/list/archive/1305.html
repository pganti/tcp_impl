<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; In case it wasn't blindingly obvious to everyone, the punchline is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Because you're using T/TCP, I can submit these 1-packet probes with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; totally random (or very pointedly non-random) source IP addresses, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; you can't filter them out by source.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But these 1-packet probes with random source addresses are not passed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the application *until* the 3WHS is completed, assuming that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; random source addresses have not had previous connections with this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server that have initialized the CC for this client.  And if you use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; random source address, the 3WHS will never complete.  So to launch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these attacks you minimally have to come from a host that supports
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; T/TCP and you must use your own source IP.
</EM><BR>
<P>That turns out not to be the case, for two reasons:
<BR>
<P>1) The existing implementation creates the TAO cache before the first
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3WHS has completed.
<BR>
<P>2) C.f. `very pointedly non-random'.  Say I pick source addresses of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known customers, or known data providers, instead.  With T/TCP, I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't have to know the port numbers they used in previous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connections, because the TAO cache applies to all connections from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that particular machine; all I have to know is that they're likely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be in the TAO cache.
<BR>
<P>There are some very subtle aspects to #2.  For example, say you have
<BR>
something that automatically detects this sort of attack and filters
<BR>
out that client.  Besides the potential for annoying real customers,
<BR>
this has other effects.  One such attack would be to get you to
<BR>
automatically filter out known search engine robots, so your site
<BR>
never appears on them.  It's likely that you wouldn't even notice
<BR>
this, and you'd just lose hits (read: potential revenue) without ever
<BR>
knowing why.  (And, of course, in most cases I could just keep
<BR>
round-robining between a number of known addresses.  You can't filter
<BR>
out everything; eventually you'd have to start doing aggregate
<BR>
filtering or timing out old entries...)
<BR>
<P>The idea may be digusting to some people (and I confess that it churns
<BR>
my own stomach a bit), but the 3WHS really does provide a certain
<BR>
amount of accountability that is important for maintaining a clean
<BR>
neighborhood.
<BR>
<P>I think a fix for this is as simple as:
<BR>
<P>* Send a random cookie in the CC.NEW.
<BR>
<P>* Return the cookie in the CC.
<BR>
<P>* If the received cookie doesn't match the cached (sent) cookie, fall
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;back to a 3WHS and reinitialize the TAO cache.
<BR>
<P>This increases the size of the CC.NEW/CC options slightly, but should
<BR>
not have any significant impact on performance.  It is incompatible
<BR>
with the old CC.NEW/CC options, but it's not as if they're widely
<BR>
deployed anyway.
