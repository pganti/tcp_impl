Hi,

<P><EM>&gt; &gt;You are of course correct indicating that the servers need to operate

<EM>&gt; &gt;with a TCP stack which operates with a larger initial cwnd window size.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What's the incentive to make the change on a particular web server?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    The web server looks a damn sight faster than others, particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    for short transactions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely - unless it turns out that it makes things *worse* for a busy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; web server (or it's downstream path);  At this point, it's still a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risky decision.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. Furthermore, I think that this in not just a problem of busy web server
<BR>
but busy network as well. I hope everybody agrees that larger initial cwnd
<BR>
window allows to introduce more data to the network per time unit (RTT). 
<BR>
<P>In 'slow start' each ACK triggers two new data packets. There is no doubt that
<BR>
with increased initial window the window will open more rapidly (especially
<BR>
during so called 'slow start' which is not slow at all). Hence, the source
<BR>
offers data more rapidly to the network.
<BR>
<P>If already busy network is bombarded with twice (or more) amount of data, our
<BR>
data transfer will not be faster. On the contrary it could become much slower
<BR>
due to wasted bandwidth on dropped packets. 
<BR>
<P>So far the slow start (initial window=1 or 2 assuming window increase during
<BR>
the handshake) was used to control amount of data offered to the net. And this
<BR>
is the behaviour we know because we were able to observe it over the years. 
<BR>
<P>We blame the servers for slow data transfers and increase the speed of data
<BR>
being thrown to the net, that's fine. However, are we really sure that the
<BR>
servers are to blame for slow transfers and not our busy networks ?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
My point is that in some cases larger initial cwnd window will prove helpful
<BR>
(if the server has speared processing power and network has speared resources)
<BR>
while for busy web servers and busy networks it could turn out to be
<BR>
disastrous. Am I wrong ?
