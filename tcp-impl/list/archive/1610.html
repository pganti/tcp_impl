<P><EM>&gt; The paper recently mentioned here about dynamically adjusting receive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; windows looks interesting.  As I understand it, their idea is to adjust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive windows based on the out-going congestion window and/or recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive throughput and a notion of fairness.  Their plan seems intended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to give every connection the largest window that maximizes total system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throughput, while honoring the familiar operating system notion of fairness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or at least avoiding starvation.  (I'd repeat the URL of the paper, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think I've lost it.)
</EM><BR>
<P>A couple corrections, and the URL.  The paper covers dynamic tuning of
<BR>
the senders socket buffer (and hence sending window).  It is dynamic
<BR>
throughout the connection, not just at startup as Eric asked in his
<BR>
original email.
<BR>
<P>For receiver window, we argue that just setting the window to max (as
<BR>
Vernon suggests) is just as effective as dynamically tuning.  The
<BR>
reason for this is that, under normal circumstances, receivers use 
<BR>
very little memory.  The data in the receive window is normally stored
<BR>
in the network.  The cases where you would need the receiver memory
<BR>
are when packets are dropped or when applications get behind.
<BR>
<P>Unless you tuned *very* conservatively, tuning would still probably
<BR>
allow for situations where loss in the network would fill up all of
<BR>
the available memory (mbufs) on the receiver.  There is perhaps a
<BR>
better case for trying to protect the system from slow applications.
<BR>
<P>In either event, data in the receive queue is eligible for dropping.
<BR>
This is a fairly draconian solution, but since (in most
<BR>
implementations) this data is not ACKed until it is delivered to the
<BR>
application, you can free up memory very simply by dropping some data
<BR>
from connections which are being memory-hogs.  In our testing, we
<BR>
never encountered a situation where this was necessary -- although we
<BR>
didn't go out of our way to look for one, either.
<BR>
<P>Oh yes, here is the URL:
