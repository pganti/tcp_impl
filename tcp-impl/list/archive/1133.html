<P>
I am looking for a way to set the initial slow start threshold to an 
<BR>
appropreate value for the delay and bandwidth of the link.
<BR>
<P>Tests have shown that setting the initial value for ssthresh to the receiver's
<BR>
advertised window depends on the receiver setting the correct window size 
<BR>
for the bandwidth and delay. 
<BR>
<P>When the advertised window and thus ssthresh are too large, the congestion 
<BR>
window grows to the link capacity and loss occurs. This frequently results in 
<BR>
a retransmission timeout and ssthresh is halved. Following this quite a long time 
<BR>
is required to reach the full link bandwidth. 
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Ongoing TCP Research Related to Satellites&quot; draft suggests:
<BR>
&quot;Hoe [Hoe96] proposes using the packet-pai algorithmr [Kes91] to determine a more
<BR>
appropriate value for ssthresh.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Having consulted these documents it is still not clear to me exactly how 
<BR>
TCP should determine the bandwidth of the link. Could someone explain 
<BR>
the use of the packet-pair algorithm and its application to TCP more 
<BR>
clearly? Is there a document that explains this more clearly?
<BR>
Would anyone be willing to share code or experience on this?
<BR>
<P>I am aware that this method for determining link bandwidth has some 
<BR>
drawbacks and is less than perfect, however expecting the receiving 
<BR>
TCP to set an appropreate window size on a per connection basis 
<BR>
is unrealistic. It seems to me that setting an arbitrarily large window
<BR>
and relying on the sending TCP to determine an appropreate initial
<BR>
ssthresh for the bandwidth and delay is the best alternative.
<BR>
<P>Thanks
