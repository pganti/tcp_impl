<P>No.  On most systems, it starts at IPPORT_RESERVED-1 (or something
<BR>
similar) and works down until it finds an unused port.
<BR>
<P>On some systems it may, but that isn't traditional behaviour.
<BR>
<P>You can argue that an application with this behaviour (ie. needless
<BR>
deterministic picking of the port) are broken, however it is common.
<BR>
<P>I often see a similar problem with ssh where I am connected via a dialup
<BR>
connection, the link goes down, ssh exits from a network read error, then
<BR>
after reconnecting I can't connect at all with ssh to the same server
<BR>
because the connection is still established on the server.  This goes on
<BR>
until I can make ssh pick a different port on my side (eg. running two
<BR>
copies at once) or the connection times out on the server (eg. keepalive,
<BR>
some output to cause it to send data).  This problem, of course, isn't
<BR>
helped by the TIME_WAIT behaviour being discussed because the connection
<BR>
is still established. 
<BR>
<P>The obvious solution would appear to be making clients randomize local
<BR>
ports better.  Doesn't eliminate problems of this type, but reduces them
<BR>
so you won't repeatedly fail.
