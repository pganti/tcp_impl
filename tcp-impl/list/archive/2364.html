<P>
<EM>&gt; Why is guessing the sequence number of the first packet before it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrives such a big deal?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because it allows you to impersonate an arbitrary IP address, provided
<BR>
you don't care about seeing what the victim sends back, and provided
<BR>
that the host you're impersonating doesn't RST the connection before
<BR>
your evil deeds can be done.
<BR>
<P>The way it works:
<BR>
<P>(1) You send a SYN, with a forged ip_src and whatever ISN you feel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like.  Except for the forged ip_src, this is a perfectly normal SYN.
<BR>
<P>(2) Victim responds, to the address you're pretending to be, ACKing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your SYN and sending its own SYN, with its own ISN.
<BR>
<P>(3) If this were a normal connection, you'd ACK its SYN.  But since the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reply goes off towards the machine you're impersonating, rather
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than to you, you have to guess the ISN in order to ACK it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acceptably.
<BR>
<P>(4) Once you've guessed the ISN, you can send data and it will be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepted as coming from the IP you're pretending to be.
<BR>
<P>I've just noticed something that's a bit disturbing, though it doesn't
<BR>
really sound like much of a practical problem (and of course it will
<BR>
now turn out to have been discussed to death back before I started
<BR>
reading the list :-).
<BR>
<P>If you know the victim's ISN to within a few guesses (where &quot;a few&quot; can
<BR>
mean as many as several thousand, depending on factors such as the
<BR>
bandwidth available), you can just flood it with SYN-ACKs using all
<BR>
possible sequence numbers.  You won't know which one worked, but one of
<BR>
them will.  (The rest will be dropped as out-of-window - are there any
<BR>
known TCPs that will generate any kind of alert upon seeing a flood of
<BR>
out-of-sequence packets?)  Since you don't know which one worked, you
<BR>
have to also flood all further data on all possible sequence numbers,
<BR>
and special care has to be taken if two or more possible sequence
<BR>
numbers are close together...but, to an extent, bandwidth can make up
<BR>
for imperfect knowledge.
<BR>
<P>Of course, as someone (vjs I think?) said, anyone who depends on peer
<BR>
IPs for authentication these days is probably being sufficiently
<BR>
foolish to deserve everything sie gets, so being able to forge someone
<BR>
else's IP is perhaps not as big a deal as it was back when everyone
<BR>
used .rhosts and hosts.equiv.
<BR>
