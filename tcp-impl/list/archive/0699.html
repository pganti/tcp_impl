<EM>&gt; In regards to all the simulations and suggestions and such, I have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How many systems on the Internet today strictly adhere to the IW=1? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I ask because I wonder if we are already gaining operational experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the Internet proper with an IW that is effectively 2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From everything I have heard, it sounds like the strict adherents are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly Solaris 2.something systems. From the dust-up over the IW between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Win95/NT and Solaris, I gather that Win95/NT have an effective IW of 2. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know that HP-UX has an effective IW of 2, and I would guess (with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard data) that most other commercial Unix offerings have that as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or we would have also heard of performance interoperability issues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between Win95/NT and those Unixes. I'll not hazard a guess for FreeBSD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Linux.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are no interoperability issues if one end does IW=1 and the
<BR>
other IW=2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess a followup question would be what proportion of the &quot;Internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic mass&quot; is comprised of &quot;ants&quot; (Win95 et al) versus &quot;mamals&quot; (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unixes).
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P><P>A more important question is what percentage of high volume web
<BR>
servers implement IW=1.  BSD variants account for a high percentage
<BR>
mostly *becasue they perform well*, but also because the PC BSD
<BR>
varients (BSDI, FreeBSD, etc) are very cost effective (IW=1).  Solaris
<BR>
and other SysV based Unix (like HP/UX) are also widely used despite
<BR>
not performing as well (IW=2).  NT is less popular as a web server
<BR>
since performance is worse yet but still significant due to religious
<BR>
convictions of some (IW=2?).  For web servers on a WAN performance is
<BR>
largely a matter of the quality of the TCP implementation.  It seems
<BR>
like a fairly even split.
<BR>
<P>It doesn't really matter whether the clients (Win95) implement IW&gt;1.
<BR>
<P>Some TCPs out there don't bother with slow start at all.  The fact
<BR>
that that hasn't yet completely killed the Internet is no reason to
<BR>
declare this a good practice.  Same with IW&gt;1.
