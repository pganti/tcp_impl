<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You must assume that the attacker has a current copy of the source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to your TCP code and local hardware for private experiments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, I'm assuming that  
</EM><BR>
<P>Until now, you consistently and repeatedly said otherwise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                                You, on the other hand, appear to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alternating between threat model where the attacker is not motivated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do anything (even forge a Received line in an email) and threat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model where the adversary is a resourceful determined enemy.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, as I said, spammers are motivated but incredibly stupid.
<BR>
People who predict ISN's are also motivated, and if there is any chance
<BR>
they'll predict even a simple counter of an ISN generator, not stupid
<BR>
(or at least not as spammers are stupid).
<BR>
<P><P>But enough of this.  You keep making statements whose literal meanings
<BR>
are inconsistent with my understandings.  When contradicted, you
<BR>
reinterpret your statements and we suddenly seem to have agreed all along.
<BR>
Then you say new things that are surprising, but are often modified
<BR>
summaries of recent statements here or statements common elsewhere. 
<BR>
I feel as I'm arguing with a creative echo of a mixture words from this
<BR>
thread, accepted sci.crypt wisdom, and executive summaries from
<BR>
counterpane.com.  Although I disagree with many of your most recent
<BR>
statements, I can't find anything strictly relevant to implementing ISN
<BR>
generators compliant with RFC 1948 and/or resistent to guessing.
<BR>
<P>So let's just leave it at this,
<BR>
and agree to disagree on whatever the issue is.
