<P>
<EM>&gt;   When the server runs out of FDs, I remove the listener FD from the select
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set as I don't want to talk to any client. Coming to the TCP/IP internals, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe any new client connections will queue up in the queue with backlog
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned by listen() system call until reaped by accept() call. If queue is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full, any new clients will timeout as they cannot contact the server. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe the time in this case is 75 seconds which is the establishment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timer. Now what I want to know is if the server never issues an accept()
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call to take these connections off the queue (this will happen because we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulled out the listener FD from the select set and so it won't fire), FOR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HOW LONG will these connections stay in the queue. I presume any client that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sends data to the connection which is in a ESTABLISHED state and queued at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server, it starts a retransmission timer and no response after 5 or 9
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minutes (recommended default of 12 retrasmissions) will elicit a RST from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the client side to the  server side. As a result of this, the server TCP/IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will remove the established connection from the queue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   So is the time related to retransmission timer?.
</EM><BR>
<P>My guess would be probably not. The client will be able to send data -
<BR>
the connection is ESTABLISHED, and that data will likely be accepted and
<BR>
ACKed. My guess would be that those connections in the listen queue will
<BR>
stay there for quite a long time. Basically until the client gets fed-up
<BR>
with a lack of response and closes. Or, you explicitly accept and close
<BR>
them yourself.
<BR>
<P>I have no guess as to what would happen if you went and did a
<BR>
listen(s,0) listen(s,1)...
<BR>
<P>If you really want those connections to go away without more direct
<BR>
intervention, you might want to use an interface that inserts the
<BR>
application between the receipt of the SYN and the sending of the
<BR>
SYN|ACK. I _think_ XTI is or can be such an interface. In that case, you
<BR>
would simply stop taking the request notificatoins and the clients would
<BR>
timeout on their connects.
