<P>
All of the arguments presented on how DiffServ got to this point are good
<BR>
ones, yet, through all of the formal processes, postings, and debates, this
<BR>
one issue of TCPs handling of IP precedence still remains.  The result of
<BR>
the formal process is that the DiffServ design
<BR>
overlooked/ignored/didn't-fully-comprehend the impact of something and now
<BR>
potentially many applications and TCP implementations may pay the penalty.
<BR>
I'm not saying the formal process was wrong, but maybe there was something
<BR>
missing from it.  I understand that it's probably too late to change the
<BR>
DiffServ spec now, but perhaps we can learn something from this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I can tell, several red flags went up that should have caused a
</EM><BR>
closer scrutiny on the impact of the DiffServ DS field:
<BR>
1. Redefining a long existing protocol header byte.  This one is a big red
<BR>
flag.  This should rarely be allowed.  Because the proper use of the
<BR>
precedence bits was somewhat weakly defined, you are bound to get many
<BR>
variations in the enforcement and handling of those bits.
<BR>
2. Redefining a long existing protocol header byte defined by the DoD.
<BR>
Bigger red flag.
<BR>
3. When it was discovered that even one TCP checked the precedence, it
<BR>
should have triggered the thought: &quot;Hey, here's a TCP that enforces the
<BR>
precedence validation so, I wonder if there might be others?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I also monitor the end2end-interest and tcp-impl lists and don't recall
<BR>
seeing any mention of the redefinition of the TOS byte.
<BR>
<P>Oh well.  Sigh...  I'm off to making sure my TCP's comply with the new
<BR>
definition.

<P><EM>&gt; If you think about it for a momenet, that reasoning is obviously
</EM><BR>
incorrect.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It assumes that everyone is required to read all IETF documents.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the point of Last Call - if you care about where the IETF is going,
<BR>
you are supposed to read <A HREF="mailto:ietf-announce@ietf.org?Subject=RE:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;236F133B43F4D211A4B00090273C79DC0E0C9B@rv-ex-2.rsvl.unisys.com&gt;">ietf-announce@ietf.org</A> and see what is being
<BR>
proposed.  You don't have to read all the documents, just the ones that
<BR>
appear relevant.  The abstract of RFC 2474 is clear that the document is
<BR>
about redefining the TOS byte.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since getting anything changed during Last Call is at best difficult
</EM><BR>
<P>The WG raised the issue of what depends on the current structure of the TOS
<BR>
byte at length, had considerable discussion, and no one brought up the TCP
<BR>
incompatibility.  It's not as though it wasn't high profile - 400+ people
<BR>
attend each diffserv meeting.  But even so, it was on the radar as a
<BR>
significant issue, and I think it would have been treated very seriously
<BR>
as a last call comment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Instead of requiring changes to an unknown but apparently significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of existing TCP implementations and literally uncountable TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installations, why not strengthen the DiffServ words about upward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatibility?
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the key questions is: is it really a significant number of TCP
<BR>
implementations?  That's why this discussion should happen on tcp-impl.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the RFC 1349/RFC 1812 values of the IP TOS byte were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required to be get through unchanged (after possibly having been mapped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to other values and back again), would any existing combinations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications and host break?
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you know what to map them back to?  It's not a one-to-one mapping.
