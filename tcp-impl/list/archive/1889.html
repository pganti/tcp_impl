<P>
This is to announce the availability of a short paper describing how
<BR>
TCP's current congestion control mechanisms can be easily defeated by
<BR>
a greedy receiver.  The potential danger here is that
<BR>
performance-motivated users will modify their TCP stacks accordingly
<BR>
-- producing a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; effect.  We suggest some
<BR>
sender-side implementation modifications to mitigate the impact of
<BR>
these vulnerabilities and, perhaps more academically, some simple
<BR>
end-to-end verification algorithms that remove the need to trust the
<BR>
receiver's behavior at all (for the purposes of congestion control).

<P><P><P>TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver
<BR>
Stefan Savage, Neal Cardwell, David Wetherall, and Tom Anderson,
<BR>
ACM Computer Communications Review, October 1999.

<BR>
<P>Abstract: 
<BR>
<P>In this paper, we explore the operation of TCP congestion control when
<BR>
the receiver can misbehave, as might occur with a greedy Web
<BR>
client. We first demonstrate that there are simple attacks that allow a
<BR>
misbehaving receiver to drive a standard TCP sender arbitrarily fast,
<BR>
without losing end-to-end reliability. These attacks are widely
<BR>
applicable because they stem from the sender behavior specified in RFC 2581
<BR>
rather than implementation bugs. We then show that it is possible
<BR>
to modify TCP to eliminate this undesirable behavior
<BR>
entirely, without requiring assumptions of any kind about receiver
<BR>
behavior. This is a strong result: with our solution a receiver can
<BR>
only reduce the data transfer rate by misbehaving, thereby eliminating
<BR>
the incentive to do so.
