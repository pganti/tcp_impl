<P>
I think it's a shame that you have to get emotional about it, Bob.  My
<BR>
draft was not an emotional piece of work; it simply (and quite dryly)
<BR>
presents a number of ways to abuse T/TCP that are not possible with a
<BR>
normal TCP implementation, and points out an interoperability issue.
<BR>
Whether or not these concerns are truly significant wasn't the issue I
<BR>
was presenting when I wrote it.
<BR>
<P>I do, however, find it interesting that one of the holes was actually
<BR>
used to break into machines.  I believe this suggests that people
<BR>
should not simply turn up their noses (as you did) when someone
<BR>
publishes a paper that puts their pet project in a bad light.  Had you
<BR>
actually read the paper carefully and reviewed your implementation,
<BR>
that hole could have been fixed a long time before it was ever abused.
<BR>
Your response instead seemed childish and irresponsible.
<BR>
<P>As for your particular points:
<BR>
<P>1) There *are* cases in which the r-utilities are secure with TCP,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they are not with T/TCP.  This is basically any environment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where only `internal' addresses are permitted to establish
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connections.  With normal TCP, the responses would never be routed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the outside world, and so it would be impossible to do anything;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with T/TCP, you only need one packet.  So saying `T/TCP is no more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insecure than TCP is already' is simply fallacious.
<BR>
<P>2) Denial of service attacks are a serious issue and cannot simply be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignored.  If you really believe you can dismiss this out of hand,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell that to all the service operators who were completely screwed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by SYN flood attacks a year or so ago, and imagine it 10x worse.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There are also some more subtle and much more devastating denial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of service attacks that I didn't mention in the draft.)
<BR>
<P>I never once said `this performance improvement is undesirable'; I did
<BR>
not in any way attack that (laudable) goal.  However, your arrogant
<BR>
dismissal of the issues seems to me to cast doubt on your credibility.
<BR>
