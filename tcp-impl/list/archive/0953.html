</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The solution is to inhibit the sending of new small TCP segments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   when new outgoing data arrives from the user if the previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   transmitted data on the connection was small and remains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   unacknowledged (small == less than max. segment size).

<P>Hey David,
<BR>
<P>I believe the BSD derived TCP's follow solution 2 above; certainly
<BR>
AIX does.  The only difference between 1 and 2 as you describe
<BR>
them above seems to be the size of the segment in question.  Solution 
<BR>
1 forces TCP to behave in something similar to a stop-and-wait flow 
<BR>
control protocol, i.e., even if the segment is a full MTU size wait
<BR>
for ACKs to come back.  The spirit of the Nagle algorithm is to
<BR>
reduce the use of small packets.  Solution 2 means `have at most
<BR>
one outstanding small packet per conversation.'
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me that solution 2 more directly addresses Nagle's concern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while disturbing other traffic less.  E.g., consider the case of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sending an HTTP reply that has a size of 1.5*mss.  Nagle's algorithm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has the effect of sending the first segment immediately but delaying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sending of the second (half-full) segment until the first segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has been acknowledged.  This clearly is unacceptable for any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application that uses request/response style communication over a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single TCP connection.
</EM><BR>
<P>John Heidemann has a good writeup on this very issue that appeared
<BR>
in CCR last year.  It turns out Nagle isn't really an issue with 1.0
<BR>
traffic, since closing the connection forces the data out with the
<BR>
FIN.  However, it does affect 1.1 traffic, or 1.0 using persistent
<BR>
connections, where the connection stays open.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's interesting to note that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; description of Nagle's algorithm in Steven's TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reads:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	[The Nagle] algorithm says that a TCP connection can have only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	one outstanding small segment that has not yet been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	acknowledged.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is much closer to solution 2 than solution 1.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I mentioned, this seems to be what BSD does.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, apart from implementation complexit/speed issues, are there any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons not to use Solution 2?
</EM><BR>
<P>Is there a big difference between the two solutions in terms of
<BR>
implementation complexity or speed?  I don't see it.
<BR>
<P>There is a related issue about how disabling Nagle on each connection
<BR>
is a performance issue, since it's on the fast path for serving an
<BR>
HTTP request, but that doesn't sound like what you're talking about.
