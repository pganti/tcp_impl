<P>
I must have missed something.
<BR>
<P>If we don't have this, you can take the destination port, convert to a
<BR>
table address, use the sequence number,
<BR>
do some calculations and come up with a buffer address and an offset. If
<BR>
you want to mess up the layering
<BR>
of your stack, they are all things you can do now.
<BR>
<P>or using RDMA
<BR>
<P>You tell the would the contents of your table, have the server play with
<BR>
the data so detailed,
<BR>
the server sends back info in this option.
<BR>
<P>---&gt;An attacker plays with the data so returned.
<BR>
<P>The client instead of doing the port to table translation to determine
<BR>
where to send the data
<BR>
from the packet , does a port to table translation to find the table to
<BR>
detect malicious corruption's
<BR>
of the option.
<BR>
<P>How can you assume anything in the option is nothing but rubbish until
<BR>
such
<BR>
a translation and check is done?
<BR>
<P><P>1) Haven't you only changed the reason to do the port to table
<BR>
translation.
<BR>
2) Have completely messed up the layering of your stack. Ok people do it,
<BR>
but as an option?
<BR>
3) Provided a whole new farm yard of bugs and potential attacks?
<BR>
<P>As I read more and more RFC's one question I am constantly asking, why are
<BR>
people making this terrific
<BR>
protocol more and more complicated.
<BR>
<P>Isn't it difficult enough to implement already ( I think it is anyway).

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It enables the construction of a simple hardware accelerator that

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without hardware acceleration, the option enables the protocol stack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to decrease the number of copies it must do.
</EM><BR>
<P>1) I think your a bit game if you assume the data in the option is
<BR>
anything other than a story that aims to mislead.
<BR>
2) If you want to play this game why can't you use the port, sequence
<BR>
number and a table? All things available
<BR>
to you without advertising the state of your system.

<EM>&gt; The TCP RDMA option is an annotation and requires no modifications to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher layer protocols. It can be used with popular protocols such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HTTP, NFS, and CIFS, along with new protocols.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The TCP option also provides a bit to indicate application-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message boundaries. The bit enables out-of-order processing of the TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive queue, potentially decreasing service times in the presence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packet drops and improving performance on parallel systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Out of order processing assumes the data that didn't arrive one day will.
<BR>
Is that a valid
<BR>
assumption on the internet? What happens with packets that are received
<BR>
more than once,
<BR>
do you DMA over the previous data thus corrupting the changes that have
<BR>
been made
<BR>
by the application? Do you make the rule the application may not alter the
<BR>
DMA buffers?
<BR>
Or do you check for this condition? Is this check in your acceleration
<BR>
hardware?
<BR>
<P>I assume you believe you still only move the sequence number forward if
<BR>
all data has
<BR>
been received to that sequence number. Is this done in the acceleration
<BR>
hardware?
<BR>
<P>By the time you have checked that the option is valid, updated your
<BR>
received
<BR>
sequence number, and made sure you are not DMAing  over data the
<BR>
application already
<BR>
has, what have you gained that could not be had without this option and a
<BR>
restructure of a stack.
<BR>
<P>P.S. Maximum of two copies in the stack I wrote, one from card to
<BR>
ip_buffer, and an
<BR>
optional copy from ip_buffer to application_buffer. I don't believe I am
<BR>
partially smart.
<BR>
I deceive the introduction is misleading.
