<P><EM>&gt; You must assume that the attacker has a current copy of the source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to your TCP code and local hardware for private experiments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, I'm assuming that.  You, on the other hand, appear to be
<BR>
alternating between threat model where the attacker is not motivated
<BR>
to do anything (even forge a Received line in an email) and threat
<BR>
model where the adversary is a resourceful determined enemy.
<BR>
<P>Naturally, assuming the latter is safer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Of course, they're valuable.  They give one much more entropy than one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could ever possibly want for a very good PRNG.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is an obviously incorrect, or at least very carelessly worded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryptographic claim.  Even the best crypto PRNG can be trivially and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely quickly reversed if you know all but 5 or 6 of its initial state.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this context, you must assume the bad guy knows which of the 5 or 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; input bits are variable, because the bad guy has a copy of your source.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, 5 or 6 bits of total entropy would not be enough (the
<BR>
attacker could manually try all the combinations).  However, something
<BR>
like 128 total bits of entropy are enough for a lot of pseudo-random
<BR>
numbers.  And, with .01 bits of entropy per packet, you'd accumulate
<BR>
that only after 12800 packets (and could save that across reboots to
<BR>
disk or non-volatile memory).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your 0.01 bits/packet of entropy makes no sense to me.  If there were only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.01 or even 1 bit of entropy in packet arrival times, then we wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need RTP and the many other ToS and QoS mechanisms.  Even the telco guys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have switched to packets 25 years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was making a conservative estimate.  Jitter that was caused by the
<BR>
network is disregarded, since the adversary can observe it.  I was
<BR>
assuming that jitter caused by local bus contention and interrupt
<BR>
latency is about 6us--this is what we seem to observe.  On a machine
<BR>
with microsecond clock resolution this would yield 2-3 bits.  Of
<BR>
course, there's a positive correlation between delay and load, so the
<BR>
real entropy is less than that.  There may be other factors that would
<BR>
decrease the amount of entropy (for example, one could have a clock
<BR>
that is more likely to report last bit as being 1 than 0).  The .01
<BR>
bits figure seems to be sufficiently conservative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Consider the 10 MHz Ethernet packets I was talking about.  They won't come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more often than once every 64 microsecond slot time.
</EM><BR>
<P>And you assume that this time is uniformly distributed?
<BR>
<P>The rest assumes no correlation of this time with anything else, ideal
<BR>
clock, etc.  The ideal clock assumption, by the way, seems to not
<BR>
co-exist very well with the assumption of uniform distribution of time
<BR>
of arrival within slot time.
<BR>
<P>In any case, this is largely immaterial.  What I was saying is that
<BR>
there's no need for TCP implementation to use true random numbers
<BR>
directly for ISN generation purposes.  In fact, even very small
<BR>
amounts of entropy are sufficient for generation of unpredictable
<BR>
ISNs.  On the other hand, over-optimistic assumptions about the amount
<BR>
of entropy in various inputs can lead to implementations that would
<BR>
generate more easily predictable ISNs than a naive
<BR>
&quot;get-some-entropy-and-run-arcfour&quot; approach.
