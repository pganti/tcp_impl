<P><EM>&gt; RFC 2018 simply says &quot;may be sent in a SYN&quot;, which must include both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;SYN&gt; and &lt;SYN,ACK&gt; for RFC 2018 to work.  I assume this must be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oversight in the wording, but it is now the specification, so I suppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more implementations may start doing this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oops, it was indeed an oversight.  Well, I'm not sure - we were pretty careful
<BR>
to try to leave a trace of wiggle room in places where the community wanted us
<BR>
to be more restrictive than we felt absolutely necessary.
<BR>
<P>However let me clarify:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the SACK people would like this option too - Matt Mathis told me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; afterwards however that currently SACK options must be sent with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; SYN as some implementations fall over if the first TCP option is sent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; with a non-SYN segment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this actually still true?  Are any of the TCPs with this bug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still in significant use?
</EM><BR>
<P>My conversation was slightly garbled.   The problem is that 1323 timestamps
<BR>
must be committed (on or off) on the SYN and SYN-ACK.  Once committed you are
<BR>
stuck if you got it wrong.
<BR>
<P>Since timestamps so badly waste header compressed slow links, most vendors
<BR>
ship systems that default to RFC 1323 off.  This adds yet another step for 
<BR>
ordinary people to do wrong before they can get decent rates out of any well
<BR>
any connected workstation (e.g. almost any system at a university).
<BR>
<P>It would be better if all connections could start w/o time stamps and
<BR>
automaticly turn them on when the data rate reaches some threshold.  I believe
<BR>
that accepting such a late TS option is a 2 line code change (triggering it is
<BR>
harder of course).
<BR>
<P>However, this was expressly forbidden by 1323 due to a couple of (now ancient)
<BR>
systems known to die horrible deaths on unexpected TCP options.  Nobody has any
<BR>
reasonable estimates of the residual population of these system.
<BR>
<P>In my copious spare time I would love to run a semi-production web server that
<BR>
always sent late experimental (unpublished) options to see if I could detect
<BR>
any systems with bugs.  I would bet not, and would then consider proposing to
<BR>
revise 1323 to allow and even encourage late TS options.  (In my spare time!)
<BR>
<P>I wish that somebody would actually try this experiment or reconstruct more
<BR>
details of the history.   Perhaps SGI has already done this well enough because
<BR>
SACK-enabled on the SYN-ACK is guaranteed to be unexpected.
<BR>
<P>This prohibition on late TCP options is thwarting at least 2 reasonable
<BR>
proposals for TCP options, including the RST error code.
