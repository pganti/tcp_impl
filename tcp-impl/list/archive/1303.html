<EM>&gt; From: &quot;Charles M. Hannum&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mycroft@mit.edu?Subject=Re:%20status%20of%20T/TCP&In-Reply-To=&lt;199809081708.LAA05457@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">mycroft@mit.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I *think* we could actually fix this, by using some sort of exchange
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the first connection (which always does a full 3WHS to initialize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the connection count) and a hashing mechanism similiar to RFC-1948 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ensure that future SYN-data-FIN packets came from the same source as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the initial connection request (or at worst a snooper in between).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would effectively restore the `security' (in this case, really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the *accountability*) of normal TCP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't worked out the details, but it seems emminently doable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but why bother? Instead of inventing yet another mechanism to keep
<BR>
state above T/TCP, why not simply modify the application protocol to use
<BR>
TCP?  Why not arrange to pay the price of the 3-way handshake/A&amp;A once,
<BR>
and then re-use the TCP connection for several transactions?
<BR>
<P>I've long liked the idea of reducing the number of packets in the TCP
<BR>
3-way handshake.  (It was one of the selling points of XTP).  However,
<BR>
your point about the utility of delaying committing significant resources
<BR>
until at least one round-trip of packets has at least somewhat verified
<BR>
the identity of the peer is very interesting.
<BR>
<P>Besides your notion of some kind of hashing/pre-reservation, you might do
<BR>
something in you HTTP server example such as start the HTTP query for
<BR>
requests that arrived by T/TCP, but perpare to abandon it early.  Either:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. respond to the initial T/TCP packet by both starting the query
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sending a window-probe-style TCP segment to the client.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the client does not respond quickly (say &lt;1 sec), abort the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query.  Yes, this sounds like it would require violations of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;various layering religions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. limit the total number of processes doing work for T/TCP requests
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that have not been ACK'd.  If the system gets load, drop a random
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request, much like the random-drop defense to SYN attacks.  This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not be distinguished by clients from ordinary packet losses,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so would be harmless, except for the work wasted before request
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is dropped.  I think this should not offend the layering priests
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except in concept, since it would require no hacks in the stack.
<BR>
<P>Still, why bother?  Never mind newer versions of HTTP.  What benefit does
<BR>
T/TCP give, other than a speed-up by one RTT of the initial response?
<BR>
Since all HTTP clients now use more than one TCP connection, delays for
<BR>
3-way handshakes after the first are insignificant, aren't they?  Given
<BR>
commerical HTTP servers that can server more hits/second than you can buy
<BR>
Internet bandwidth no matter what your budget, there doesn't seem much
<BR>
that T/TCP can do for servers.
