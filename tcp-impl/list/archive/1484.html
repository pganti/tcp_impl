<EM>&gt; &gt; One related question: Does everybody support applications disabling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Nagle on a per-circuit basis, as mandated by 4.2.3.4 in RFC 1122?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IRIX does.
</EM><BR>
<P>] Linux does.
<BR>
<P><P>Let's not have a brust of 10,000 messages listing implementations
<BR>
that do support TCP_NODELAY.  Instead, let's wait for the few, if
<BR>
any, announcements of those that don't.
<BR>
<P>You would expect that the TCP_NODELAY setsockopt() would work on most BSD
<BR>
derived TCP stacks, including IRIX, BSD/OS, HP-UX, Ultrix and the other
<BR>
(OSF?) DEC system, System V Release 4 and beyond, AIX, and the zillions
<BR>
of others I can't think of in 3 seconds.  TCP_NODELAY also seems to work
<BR>
in some other popular, not exactly BSD-derived systems, notably at least
<BR>
some &quot;winsock&quot; libraries for WIN32 platforms, including WIN95, WIN98, and
<BR>
NT 4.0.  (I've rather limited confidence that they do everything right,
<BR>
but at least those Microsoft system do not complain when my code makes
<BR>
the TCP_NODELAY request.)
<BR>
<P>I bet there are more systems that do not support the Nagle algorithm at
<BR>
all than those that support the Nagle algorithm but cannot turn it off
<BR>
(except, of course, systems that cannot be changed to want to turn it off,
<BR>
such as embedded code burned into ROM).
<BR>
<P>Is TCP_NODELAY somewhere in POSIX?  I bet so.  
<BR>
And also DLPI?  Ditto.
