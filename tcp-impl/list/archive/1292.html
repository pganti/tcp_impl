<P>1. Introduction
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transaction TCP [RFC-1644] specifies a set of extensions to the TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol to improve performance of client/server transaction systems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic ideas behind T/TCP are to:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) avoid the normal 2MSL delay (TCP TIME-WAIT state [STD-007]) before
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a new instance of a connection can be created, and
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) shorten the initial 3-way handshake [STD-007] used to establish a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection and synchronize the two TCPs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the original memo does not discuss the security implications
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of these extensions, several exist.  This memo explains some of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more obvious ones.
<BR>
<P>2. Host-based Authorization
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a host-based authorization system, we permit a TCP connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the source IP address of the incoming request.  This is the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model used, for example, by the BSD `rlogin' program.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3-way handshake (3WHS) in TCP provides minimal security against
<BR>
<P><P><P>C. Hannum                                                       [Page 1]

RFC ?                    T/TCP Security Problems          September 1996
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoofing the source IP address, by requiring the client to know the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initial send sequence number (ISS) of the server.  Unfortunately,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's possible in many cases to guess the ISS.  Although the weakness
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the ISS as a security device has put a major kink in host-based
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorization, it is still widely used, and there are environments in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which it is currently secure.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(See `Sequence Number Attacks' below for some additional comments on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISS prediction.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T/TCP defines a mechanism (`TCP accelerated open', or `TAO') for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short-circuiting TIME-WAIT state, using a `connection count' option.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that segments for a new instance of a connection will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a higher connection count than, and therefore can be easily
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinguished from, packets for older instances.  This is implemented
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using a per-host cache of the previous received connection counts,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and typically a global counter for outgoing connection counts.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the primary focus of T/TCP is to allow data to be sent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and acted upon without a full 3WHS having taken place.  Since there
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be no TAO cache entry the first time we contact a host, T/TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requires us to go through a full 3WHS to initialize the connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count.  Therefore, we have at least the modest security of TCP.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so one might think.  It should be apparent, however, that the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methods used to guess ISSes (primarily, opening a dummy connection,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeing what the current ISS is, and then predicting what it will be)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be used to guess the connection count.  Worse, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection count is even more trivial to predict than the ISS.  It is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore a simple matter to submit one-sided requests to a T/TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server, possibly spoofing such services as rlogin.
<BR>
<P>3. SYN Flooding
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, the focus of T/TCP is to allow the server to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive and act upon data from the client without performing a full
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3WHS.  Even when it falls back to the 3WHS, a T/TCP server will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typically store the data it received in the initial SYN packet.  This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means that a SYN packet may cause even more resources to be consumed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a normal embryonic TCP connection.  This significantly increases
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the possible resource consumption caused by SYN flooding.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse, with the connection count prediction previously mentioned,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's possible to submit an arbitrary number of queries to a server
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(for example, CGI requests that are known to be expensive), with no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record of the real origin.  It could be very difficult or even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossible for the maintainer of a server to determine who is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flooding it.
<BR>
<P><P><P>C. Hannum                                                       [Page 2]

<BR>
<P><P>4. Pre-SYN Queueing
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a side note, [RFC-1644] briefly mentions a `Pre-SYN Queue', which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would store incoming data for a connection that is received before
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the SYN.  This would improve performance in the case where a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant amount of data is already available for the client to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send, but the SYN packet happens to get lost.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with connection count prediction, a naive implementation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-SYN queueing could allow some untracable prankster to consume a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large amount of memory on the server.  This can be fixed merely by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tossing the pre-SYN queues when the server is short on memory.
<BR>
<P>5. Sequence Number Attacks
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been several suggestions on methods for creating ISSes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that might prevent guessing, or at least make it more difficult.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these involve simply using a random number for the ISS, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;randomizing the periodic increment, in a way that would break TCP's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ability to recognize data from an old instance of a connection.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can be discarded.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellovin suggests adding a hash based on the local and foreign IP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addresses and port numbers to the existing clock-based ISS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RFC-1948].  This effectively gives each connection its own ISS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key point of this technique is that the same combination of IP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addresses and ports must generate the same hash number, or we would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again break TCP as above.  Of course, this has a significant security
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impact.  If a spoofer can create multiple connections to a server
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the same address and port, the hash function just rotates the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISS space, and has no real security benefit.  With normal TCP, TIME-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAIT state would make this a very slow process; however, with T/TCP,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is not the case.
<BR>
<P>6. Conclusions
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns, combined with the fact that sending a FIN with a SYN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly violates the processing rules in [STD-007], seem to indicate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that T/TCP needs more development before it is ready for general use.
