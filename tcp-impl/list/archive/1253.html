<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 5-sec?) concerned LANs.  Why would you be less offended by ~80 byte
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; HTTP/TCP/IP keepalives than by 40 byte TCP/IP keepalives, both at the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rate?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Point conceeded.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then we agree on the significant issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why are TCP keepalives a problem out in the open?  Are you saying that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; HTTP keepalive would use less bandwidth than the current practice?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Im still dubious.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why are you dubious instead of not dubious?  I can't get worked up either
<BR>
way, except by religious statements from zealots flogging one sect or
<BR>
another of layering religion.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I don't dispute that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	a) People want to do it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	b) That whether it is good practice or not doesnt matter for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   internal network usage (ie non shared resource)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	c) Given a &amp; b there should be a way to set the value by socket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   (or TLI) and that it should be specified in 1003.1g
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I dont think we however should look at this issue until someone has hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figures on what the cost of a change from the status quo 
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope we agree that regardless of theoretical, religious, or other merit,
<BR>
the status quo is the use of TCP keepalives, and not at silly, red herring
<BR>
rates like 15 seconds.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                                                          would be at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least in rough terms for packets/byte overheads on the existing internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backbones. I'd like to see figures from a &quot;neutral&quot; source.
</EM><BR>
<P>The advantage of the new POSIX knob (thanks for the notes about it) is
<BR>
that it is cheaper and easier for the system to manage the timers and get
<BR>
them right than for applications.  The system must page-in or otherwise
<BR>
make ready to run and then run the application when its keepalive timer
<BR>
expires, while the system can do the usual economy-of-scale another hacks
<BR>
for a TCP keepalive.  Also, if you require that applications do their own
<BR>
keepalives, then most will use a simplisitic fixed interval instead of
<BR>
nice exponential or otherwise increasingly less frequent scheme.  I think
<BR>
that would be a significant problem.
<BR>
<P>The big disadvantage of a POSIX style knob is that applications that do
<BR>
not need it will turn it on, and/or use unnecessarily tiny values simply
<BR>
because it is there and easy to use.  I think this is already a valid
<BR>
concern.

<BR>
<P>I don't see any difference.  The same TCP retransmission timer will expire
<BR>
or not in either case, right?  One is more bytes and so would use more
<BR>
time on the wire and might (or might not) take more space in router queues
<BR>
and so might contribute more to congestion.  Neither should be involved
<BR>
when the TCP connection is itself suffering or contributing significantly
<BR>
to congestion.

<BR>
<P>There is often little difference between keepalives and idle timers.
<BR>
However, I have often been inconvenienced and quite irritated by WWW
<BR>
stockbrokers that kill my secure HTTP connections when I stop to ponder
<BR>
or look at other pages for literally a couple of minutes.  There is a real
<BR>
difference between an idle but alive connection and a dead connection.
