International Shoe Manufacturing Corp Update: 
<BR>
International Shoe Manufacturing Corp. (Ticker-ISHO) has acquired the final-stage
<BR>
financing to begin full-scale production at its plants in India. The $4.75 million is being
<BR>
used to purchase the final equipment needed to begin production at the company’s existing
<BR>
plant in India. With equipment in place, the company projects net profits of over $25
<BR>
million a year within two years.
<BR>
<P>The company stated that the financing will be followed up by a $9 million dollar IPO in
<BR>
India, anticipated for March 1999. The IPO will be handled by underwriters in India, and
<BR>
will leave ISM with control of its wholly owned subsidiary in India. The proceeds of the
<BR>
IPO will pay off the $4.75 million dollar financing. The balance will be used for the
<BR>
acquisition of additional shoe manufacturing.    
<BR>
<P>ISHO is in the business of manufacturing athletic footwear for the world’s leading shoe
<BR>
companies. It owns a 23,000-square-foot plant located in the protected “free trade zone” in
<BR>
Noida, just outside of New Delhi, India, where skilled labor is plentiful and very
<BR>
inexpensive. The Indian government recently developed new economic policy to attract
<BR>
foreign investment that is export-oriented, and could employ large numbers of people. 
<BR>
ISM is the only athletic shoe manufacturer in India directed toward the international
<BR>
market. It currently has contracts with Adidas and The Pentland Group. These two
<BR>
companies have agreed to purchase all the shoes ISM can manufacture. 
<BR>
<P>The athletic shoe industry is estimated at $14.25 billion a year. The world’s leading shoe
<BR>
companies such as Adidas, Nike, and Reebok do not manufacture shoes. They are design
<BR>
and marketing organizations that spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year getting their
<BR>
products sold. They then rely on others to manufacture to their specifications. Almost, if
<BR>
not all athletic shoe manufacturers are privately owned, benefiting from the hundreds of
<BR>
millions of dollars spent on advertising by the name-brand companies. The result is an
<BR>
open purchase order where such manufacturers  literally can sell every pair of shoes they
<BR>
can produce. A business like this lends itself to being privately held due to the large cash
<BR>
flow allowing for internal financing. International Shoe Manufacturing Corp. is the only
<BR>
company known to exist that offers a public investor the opportunity to own a share of this
<BR>
highly lucrative business in a pure  investment play.
