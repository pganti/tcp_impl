<P>Abstract
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This draft discusses variations in the TCP 'slow-start restart' (SSR)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm, and the unintended failure of some variations to properly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart in some environments. SSR is intended to avoid line-rate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bursts after idle periods, where TCP accumulates permission to send
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the form of ACKs, but does not consume that permission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately. SSR's original &quot;restart after send is idle&quot; is commonly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implemented as &quot;restart after receive is idle&quot;. The latter
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unintentionally fails to restart for bidirectional connections where
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sender's burst is triggered by a reverse-path data packet, such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in persistent HTTP. Both the former and latter are shown to permit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bursts in other circumstances. Three solutions are discussed, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their implementations evaluated.

<P>Introduction
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow-Start Restart (SSR) describes one TCP behavior to respond to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long sending pauses in an open connection.  When a sender becomes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle, the normal ack-clocking mechanism which regulates traffic is no

<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longer present and the sender may introduce a burst of packets into
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the network as large as the current congestion window (CWND).  Such a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burst may be too large for the intermediate routers to handle and may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be too large for the receiver to handle at one time as well.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A send timer was first proposed [JK90] to detect idle sending
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periods; the recommended response is to close the congestion window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and perform a new slow-start.  However, a footnote to this first
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed solution noted that send/receive symmetry on the channel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meant that a receive timer could be used instead to achieve the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results.  As this second solution takes advantage of a timer that is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already required (to detect packet loss) it was implemented by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacobson and Karels.  This solution has been repeated in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations which derive from their work.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursty connections, such as the persistent connections required in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/1.1 [FGMFB97] have been found to interact in meaningful ways
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with SSR [6].  In fact, it was discovered that SSR never occurs with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/1.1 [Poo97].  This is because a new request will reset the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive timer (as suggested in the footnote in [JK90]) and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending pause will not be detected [Tou97].
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, both timer solutions depend on the retransmit timeout (RTO)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cannot detect send pauses that are shorter than this duration.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, the sender may transmit a burst as large as the full
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion window.
<BR>
<P>Burst detection.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways of determining whether a connection is at risk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sending a burst of packets into the channel.  We will discuss each
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method below, from the least radical to the most radical.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Receive Timer:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a receive timer is the most common burst detection method.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is attractive because it is simple and makes use of an existing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timer.  However, a receive timer does not properly detect bursts in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/1.1 because the timer is cancelled when the request packet is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received.  Further, when the connection is idle for less than a full
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RTO, a burst cannot be detected.  Such a burst can happen when the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection is &quot;nearly idle&quot; or when acks are lost or reordered.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Send Timer:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A send timer is the reciprocal solution to using a receive timer.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it requires a new timestamp field to be maintained, it clearly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detects send pauses and corrects the problem presented by HTTP/1.1.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as with the receive timer, it cannot detect bursts that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could happen before a full RTO.
<BR>

<BR>
Hughes, et al.             Restart After Idle             March 30, 1998
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Packet Counting:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative method examines the unused portion of the congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window to determine if the capacity to burst exists.  This method is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simple, it uses existing information to make its decision, and it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solves both the HTTP/1.1. problem as well as the RTO problem.  In
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addition, it addresses the problem that needs to be solved (bursts)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of a specific circumstance where the problem could happen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(send pauses).  However, where timer detection avoids defining a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burst (it defines idle periods instead), here a burst must be defined
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before it can be detected.  One possible definition is the situation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the available portion of the sending window is some proportion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the entire congestion window, say 50%.  Another definition places
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a numerical limit on the available portion of the congestion window,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say 4 or CWND-1 packets.
<BR>
<P>Burst Response
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a burst is detected, there are several different ways to take
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action.  The different possibilities are listed below, again from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least to most radical.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Full Restart:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the congestion window to one packet and re-entering slow-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start, the original slow-start restart is one response.  This was the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solution proposed by J&amp;K.  This is a very conservative response and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it defeats most of the speedup that HTTP/1.1 provides [HOT97].
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current proposals [FAP97] have suggested increasing the initial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window from 1 packet to 4 packets.  Further, depending on the method
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of burst detection, Full Restart can be far more punitive than it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be.  Coupled with a timer, full restart is most likely to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond to a completely empty congestion window.  Coupled with Packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting, the response could close the window too far, even smaller
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the amount of outstanding data.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Window Limiting:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a modified version of Full Restart which solves the problem
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created by using Packet Counting to detect bursts.  With this type of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response, the congestion window is reduced to the amount of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outstanding data plus the slow-start initial window (1, 2, or 4).  It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works exactly like Full Restart in the idle case, but is successful
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at controlling bursts in an active connection.  Further, in an active
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection, it effectively implements a leaky bucket of the initial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window size for the accumulation of send opportunity based on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receipt of acks.  This solution is fairly conservative, especially as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it defaults to Full Restart, but more importantly, sending
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity is simply lost if not used, and is not available for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paced output.  Also, it forces negative congestion feedback on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion window.

Hughes, et al.             Restart After Idle             March 30, 1998
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Burst Size Limitation:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a burst is detected, its effects are limited, the sender may not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send any more than a preset number of packets into the network.  It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is less conservative than the first two responses in that it does not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affect the size of the congestion window, and it is simple to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implement, simply count up the number of packets you can send and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop when you reach the limit.  Whether to wait for an ack or some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other signal to resume sending is an implementation detail.  Lastly,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this burst response can be performed after each ack or with each
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send. The behavior is slightly different in each case.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Pacing:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a burst is detected, packets are dribbled into the network until
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sender starts receiving acks and normal maintenance can be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resumed [VH97].  This solution is very easy on the network and scales
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well in cases of high bw/delay.  However, it requires a new timer and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parameter tuning require more research.
<BR>
<P>Implemented Solutions
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will examine combinations of the different detection and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response methods presented above.  Each of the solutions that below
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been implemented in some form.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;BSD Implementation (Jacobson and Karels)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common implementation uses a receive timer coupled with Full
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart.  This is the implementation that causes the interaction
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems with HTTP/1.1.  The obvious alternative is to implement a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send timer as originally intended and use Full Restart.  There are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several drawbacks to this solution.  First, a send timer adds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional state and serves no purpose other than to correct the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bursting behavior after send pauses.  Second, forcing a slow-start in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this situation is problematic for HTTP/1.1.  A slow-start for each
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new user request adds a delay burden to characteristically small HTTP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responses. Further, the HTTP user request pattern is unpredictable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible for the user to make a new request before the send
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timer expires, triggering a burst that would defeat such a timer.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Maximum Burst Limitation (Floyd)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floyd has proposed a coupling of Packet Counting with Burst Size
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitation.  This solution has been implemented in ns and it prevents
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sender from transmitting a series of back-to-back packets larger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the user configured burst limit (suggested to be 4 packets)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[NS97].  There are several issues involved with recovering from a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burst and the ns implementation doesn't address them consistently.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not clear when the sender is allowed to send again after
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending the the first limited burst of packets.  One implementation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requires the sender to wait for the burst timer to expire.  Another
<BR>
<P><P><P>Expires Sept. 30, 1998                                          [Page 4]
<BR>

<BR>
Hughes, et al.             Restart After Idle             March 30, 1998
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to allow a series of short bursts.  Another issue is how the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulation implementation and usage translates to a live network
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situation.  The implementation of this solution can range from simple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to more complex.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Congestion Window Monitoring (Hughes, Touch, and Heidemann)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposed solution combines Packet Counting with Window Limiting.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever (CWND - outstanding data &gt; 4), we reduce CWND to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(outstanding data + 4).  The choice of 4 packets is discussed in with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the implementation details below.  Congestion Window Monitoring (CWM)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allows the congestion window to grow normally but shrinks the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion window as the sender becomes idle.  It also prevents the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sender from transmitting any bursts larger than 4 packets in response
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a new request. Because CWM is not dependent on any timers, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss of an ack or a nearly idle connection cannot cause any bursts.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CWM is similar to Burst Limitation, but avoids the burst by reducing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CWND, rather than by inhibiting the sends directly.  As a result, we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoid the potential problem of sequential calls to TCP_output, which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would cause bursts in the former, but not the latter.  CWM also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causes TCP to use the feedback of 'not using the CWND fast enough',
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which results in a decrease in the CWND.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CWM effectively imposes a leaky bucket type limitation on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion window.  The window is allowed to grow and be managed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normally but the sender is not allowed to save up any sending
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunities.  Any opportunity that is not used is lost.  This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property of CWM forces interleaved reception of acks and processing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sends.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Rate Based Pacing (Visweswaraiah and Heidemann)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate Based Pacing combines the Pacing response with either a Send
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timer or Packet Counting.  It avoids slow-start when resuming after
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending pauses and allows the normal clocking of packets to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gracefully restarted.  When a burst potential is detected, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm meters a small burst of packets into the channel [VH97].
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBP is the least conservative solution to the bursting problem
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it continues to make use of the pre-pause congestion window.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If network conditions have changed significantly, maintaining the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previous window could cause the paced connection to be overly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggressive as compared to other connections.  (Although some work
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggests congestion windows are stable over multi-minute timeframes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[BSSK97].)  More recently pacing been suggested for use in wireless
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;networking scenarios [BPK97], and for satellite connections.

<P>Experimental Comparisons

<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of CWM with HTTP/1.1 support the above observations.  In all of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the traces, the response pattern for the first request is the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with each method.  This shows that CWM allows the congestion window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to grow normally.  Because of the different actions taken by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three algorithms, the response pattern for the second request differs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as would be expected.  [We have graphs available upon request]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second request arrives at the server after the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmission timeout (RTO), normal FreeBSD allows the server to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond with a burst of packets.  FreeBSD using a send timer responds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by entering slow-start. CWM allows a 4 packet burst.  When the second
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request arrives at the server before the RTO, both timer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations allow a burst.  CWM again limits the burst to 4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets.  Note, RTO is the common timer limit, but any value would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have the same results, depending on when the second request was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presented in relation to the timer.
<BR>
<P>Implementation of Congestion Window Monitoring
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congestion Window Monitoring requires a simple modification to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existing TCP output routines.  The changes required replace the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current idle detection code.  Replace the existing 3 lines of code:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle = (snd_max == snd_una)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (idle &amp;&amp; now - lastrcv &gt;= rto)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cwnd = 1;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the following 3 lines of code:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxwin = 4 + snd_nxt - snd_una;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (cwnd &gt; maxwin)
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packet counting is implemented by line 1.  Lines 2 and 3 implement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Window Limitation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of limiting the available congestion window to 4 packets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is based on the normal operation of TCP.  An ACK received by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sender may be in response to the receipt of 2 packets, allowing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another 2 to be sent.  Further, normal window growth may require the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending of a third packet.  Lastly, in slow-start with delayed ACKs,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the receipt of an ACK can trigger the sending of 4 packets. Thus, 4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets is a reasonable burst to send into the network.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the initial window in slow-start to 4 packets has already
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been proposed [FAP97].  The effects of this change have been explored
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in simulation in [PN98] and in practice in [AHO97].  Such a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modification to TCP would cause the same behavior as our solution in

<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cases where the pause timer has expired.  It does not address the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-timeout bursting situation we are concerned with.
<BR>
<P>Conclusions
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, we propose CWM as a simple, minimal and effective fix
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the 'bug' in current TCP implementations that is exploited by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/1.1.  Modifications can be made to TCP to solve the slow-start
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart problem that are consistent with the original congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoidance specifications (i.e. a send timer).  However, we feel that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the original intended behavior is not appropriate to some current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications, specifically HTTP. Thus, we recommend Congestion Window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring to prevent bursts into the network.  Not only does this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solution solve the current problem in a simple way, it will prevent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bursting in any other situation that might arise. The 4 packet bursts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which we allow are consistent with congestion window growth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithms and with Floyd's conclusion about increasing the initial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window size.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CWM, as well as the other solutions listed, need to be re-evaluated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within emerging TCP implementations, e.g., SACK [JB88].  In general,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP has no rate pacing and uses congestion control to avoid bursts in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current implementations.  A more explicit mechanism, such as RBP or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similar proposals may be desirable in the future.
<BR>
<P>Security implications
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CWM presents no security problems.
