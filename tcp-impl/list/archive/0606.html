<EM>&gt;I'm marking the ones I care about:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         - How to compute RTO when timing more than one packet per RTT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;           (i.e., how to adjust the constants for the exponentially weighted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;           moving average)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Uh, sounds like it could be harmful.  Why?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From memory, RFC1323 implies that timestamps allow this to be done,
</EM><BR>
and that some sort of aliasing effect in the RTO calculation would be 
<BR>
removed if an RTT sample were taken on every packet. Looking
<BR>
at a slightly old version of the BSD code reveals that when RFC1323
<BR>
timestamps are used a sample will be taken on every packet.
<BR>
This will mean that old data will decay out of the RTT much faster
<BR>
than normal when using RFC1323. The open question appears to be,
<BR>
to me, whether it should be mandated that RTT samples must only be
<BR>
taken once per round trip, or if some adjusted VJ style filter
<BR>
should be applied when taking one sample per packet.
<BR>
<P>In practice I suspect the coarse 500ms timer for RTO in BSD based
<BR>
code means that any problem introduced by sampling on every packet
<BR>
will be hidden on networks with a real RTT of less than 500ms
<BR>
when the pipeline is full. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;         - How long a sending pause merits a new slow-start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Simple, use delayed-Ack TO (DATO)!  If you already released the channel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that long, you have to assume that someone else has begun to fill it, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least with 1/2 DATO bandwidth worth of packets.  And it won't hurt as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much to slow start when there already has been your own delay.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this much different than the 1 RTO timeout currently used
<BR>
in several implementations? And do you want to imply that DATO
<BR>
is fixed (e.g. to 200ms) or should it be allowed to be a computed
<BR>
quanitity?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also, MinRTO should be 200 ms and DATO should be 200-300 ms, never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shorter.  It would save a heck of a lot of useless retransmissions I see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every day.  I'm guessing that a couple stacks are using around 50 ms for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each, and that's much too short, even at T3!  All it takes is one burp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of congestion, and I see an avalanche effect.
</EM><BR>
<P>MinRTO must never be smaller than DATO, or you will fall over against
<BR>
anything that does delayed ACKs. In practice this currently means that
<BR>
you must not set MinRTO to less than 200ms. If we allow DATO to vary,
<BR>
e.g. as computed from packet interarrival times, then the issue
<BR>
becomes even more cloudy. Ideally the DATO should be included in
<BR>
the calculation of RTT, but it is not clear how to accomplish this,
<BR>
since it is not easily determined which ACKs have been delayed and which
<BR>
have not, and also it is not necessarily the case that the DATO will be
<BR>
fixed.
