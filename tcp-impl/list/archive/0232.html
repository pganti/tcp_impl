<EM>&gt; ||These machines often had 2-4 MB of memory even in the old days but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||needed to stuff everything into 640KB for purely stupid reasons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||It doesn't matter why these implementations are broken, the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||remains that they are broken and their performance will be poor.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||this leads to the conclusion that it is not possible to implement TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||in a way that TCP will not perform poorly on some hardware platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||with too little memory or software platform that can't allocate memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||for some reason, then it must simply be accepted that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||implementations cannot conform to the RFC and will perform poorly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ||
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll do my best not to resent this and take it personally.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can we refrain from emotionally charged words like &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and try and work with each other to clarify things and improve the TCP space?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All protocol implementations have corners into which they don't want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go for a variety of platform specific reasons.  The mark in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind, of a good protocol implementation is how said implementation goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into those corners and behaves under adverse circumstances in those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corners.  My intent in exposing my dirty laundry was to share hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won knowledge we at FTP found in one of those corners and to seek
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advice, which I got, in how to smooth and improve our behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in those corners.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please feel free to suggest how I can improve my product, please don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me my product is broken for doing the best balancing act it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could under the circusmstances for which it was aimed.

<P><P>What is considered the right thing for a TCP implementation to do
<BR>
should not be constrained or in any way influenced by what is best to
<BR>
accomodate a software platform design decision based on backward
<BR>
compatibility to the Intel 8088.  Today about the only thing with that
<BR>
little addressable memory will be a small appliance which is hardly a
<BR>
candidate for high speed TCP applications.  Any software platform
<BR>
design in which the memory is physically available but inaccessible
<BR>
(ie: 640KB limits) has serious shortcomings.  I appologize for using
<BR>
such emotionally charged words to describe it.
<BR>
<P>Your point is taken.
<BR>
<P>My point is that very small amounts of available buffer space must
<BR>
imply very low end-to-end performance.  The practice of advertising
<BR>
buffering that you don't have should be strongly discouraged.  
<BR>
<P>Curtis
<BR>
<P>btw- I meant to imply that DOS was broken, not someones software's DOS
<BR>
TCP stack if that's any consolation.
