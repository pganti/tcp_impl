<EM>&gt;&gt;I believe that an HTTP GET which hits an in-kernel cache satisfies the

<EM>&gt;&gt;three packets.

<EM>&gt; fascinating -- you're suggesting HTTP over datagrams.  Or at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acting like datagrams when all you really want is a datagram.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can dispense with the connection when all you want is a datagram.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is beginning to look like the DNS approach:  Just use udp
<BR>
on the first attempt, and revert to tcp when the result would be
<BR>
too large?
<BR>
<P>Frankly, given that one of the conditions given was sufficient
<BR>
resistance/defence against DoS attacks,  I doubt this will ever
<BR>
escape the lab.  A proper defence against DoS attacks is miserly
<BR>
conduct with your resources, until you've established at least
<BR>
some validity in the request - this will require a round trip from
<BR>
server to client.
<BR>
<P>If you're going to allow initial datagrams carrying data, you'll
<BR>
have to limit the size of that data, possibly using the same
<BR>
constraints as the DNS udp/tcp switch referred to above.  You might
<BR>
be thinking of a specific application for this web-service, where
<BR>
you'd control the network stack of both client and server *and*
<BR>
the network in between.  Then you've got your value-add network,
<BR>
with your own application protocol - why use http?
