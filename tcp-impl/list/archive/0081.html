<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On the trace:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; client closes with FIN, server ACKs:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; client in FIN-WAIT-2 advertising zero window (which makes a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of sense since it cannot read any more)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here is where we still seem to be having a disagreement. If the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has &quot;destroyed&quot; the socket and is no longer using the socket, then TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will never be able to deliver additional received data to the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application. In this scenario, it is wrong for the client TCP to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respond with an ACK and window advertisement of zero, since doing so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively tells its peer (the server): &quot;I'm out of buffer space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right now, but try again in a little while and things should get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better&quot;. Things will *never* get better in this case, leading to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem of hung servers.
</EM><BR>
<P>A very good point.   No alternative to that RST.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; 1.  client flushes the connection, ideally with a RFC 1122 RST
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (application has to workaround with a SO_LINGER otherwise)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would agree that this is what should happen. Please note though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the TCP should *not* go into FIN_WAIT_2 state at this point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, after a RST it goes to CLOSED.  The problem without the RST
<BR>
is that the client socket hangs around forever in FIN-WAIT-2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2.  server times out eventually. Apart from the load, here the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; server would have to deduce from the zero window received in CLOSE-WAIT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the client really meant to do a half duplex close, as opposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to advertising a zero window because of momentary buffer exhaustion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doing the above has the side effect of breaking other applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are implemented correctly. For example, I could suspend a telnet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; session, which would could cause its TCP to (eventually) advertise a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive window of 0. The window advertisement would remain zero until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I resumed the telnet session (i.e., an indeterminate amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time). It would be wrong to terminate such connections after some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrary time limit (e.g., 15 minutes).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's a good example of what I meant - you can't time out
<BR>
acknowledged probes., even in half closed states.  You can't detect
<BR>
a half duplex close on the peer without some kind of 'interrupt'
<BR>
(RST or URG or something if you want to do it in HTTP).
<BR>
<P>We agree :-)
