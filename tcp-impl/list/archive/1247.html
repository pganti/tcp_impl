<P>
<EM>&gt; I do not understand that reasoning.  Yes, in the best of all possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worlds, it might be that all applications would have keepalives.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<P>Right now the odds of a keepalive on my imap mail connection as I browse
<BR>
email occuring is pretty slim - and if it occurs its one packet. Now if
<BR>
you had a 5 minute keepalive the odds of it occuring are a lot, and you
<BR>
are generating a lot more packets per user for idle &quot;still reading that
<BR>
email, gone for a coffee&quot; etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; convinced that you would not then complain even more loudly about wasted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwdith al la the complaints about such things as the Appletalk 15-second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; babble, but never mind.  The fact is that applications do not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keepalives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Appletalk doesnt run over 1200 and 9600 baud connections
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What Im hearing from you is 90% hot air and 10% &quot;http needs fixing&quot;. Fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fix http
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do you propose to fix the many existing HTTP clients to not croak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they receive your new HTTP keepalive?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is a fact is that applications today do not have keepalives.  It fits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the definition of clinical insanity to act contrary to that fact.  Merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking as if that fact did not exist is not nececssarily evidence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insanity, but it is not evidence of anything good.
</EM><BR>
<P>The question is whether people should fix the apps or we should accept
<BR>
their idiocy and cover for them. Unfortunately I suspect the answer is
<BR>
a marketing not a technical one. 
<BR>
<P>Either way getting POSIX to define a socket option for timeout setting
<BR>
is probably a good thing (there are valid internal network cases cited
<BR>
already where its nobody elses business what people do to their lan)
