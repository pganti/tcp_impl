<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; What's the difference [on the wire] between a flush bit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; send() system call, and explicit setsockopt()'s turning off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; TCP_NODELAY off before a send() and on afterwards?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; None that I can see.
</EM><BR>
<P>I couldn't think of one either, but the issue is slippery.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The problem is that there isn't really a required correlation between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; send() calls and segments, regardless of NODELAY (or anything else I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can find, excepting _only_ the proposed flush bit, which might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; defined as guaranteeing that the last byte of the write is the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; byte of a segment).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>That sides steps my intended question.  As with previous rounds in this
<BR>
discussion of the Nagle algorithm, what we think is a correct exegesis of
<BR>
the (or a) standard is basically irrelevant.  Does it matter whether RFC
<BR>
896 talked about send() system calls, passages through tcp_output(), or
<BR>
cycles of the RFC 793 state machine?  NO!--What really matters is what
<BR>
happens in representative, currently deployed implementations.  First
<BR>
figure out the problem, and after that choose an architecture, a layering,
<BR>
and a religion.  That order is what made TCP, and the opposite is what
<BR>
made TP0-TP4/CONS-CLNS.

<BR>
] &gt; &gt; TCP currently lacks a few things that would certainly be useful to
<BR>
] &gt; &gt; applications that want something other than a byte-stream, [...]
<BR>
] &gt; 
<BR>
] &gt; Um, yeah.  I'm not quite sure what your point is.  This sounds like
<BR>
] &gt; &quot;TCP isn't all things to all applications&quot;, which doesn't really sound
<BR>
] &gt; to me like something that is possible to fix, nor do I think it would
<BR>
] &gt; be desirable to try.
<BR>
<P>I was horrified by some of the ideas.  EOF and record markers particularly
<BR>
bother me because they are so trivially implemented by the application
<BR>
and there are so many more kinds of markers than any of us would dream
<BR>
of putting into a kernel (or so I would like to think).  You would need
<BR>
at the very least all of ANSI magnetic tape markers, including &quot;my summer
<BR>
vacation&quot; naratives optionally associated with every mark.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the notion of &quot;delay sending these low priority bits
<BR>
until I find some more or you really have nothing better to do&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;send this glob&quot; immediately sound very enticing.  I think they might
<BR>
finally be an improvement on Nagle.
<BR>
<P>On the third hand, was in it this mailing list where Joe Touch and others
<BR>
tonight mentioned Gbit/sec TCP for clusters?  Every minor optional feature
<BR>
that you add to a protocol hurts enormously at the boundaries, on very
<BR>
large and fast and on very small systems.  It wouldn't take more than a
<BR>
smidgeon more improvements to transform the TCP/IP of 1985 that buried
<BR>
TP0-TP4/CONS-CLNS into a monster that makes those poor guys look agile
<BR>
and svelte.  The necessary but so far small and subtle changes including
<BR>
header prediction, fast retransmission, fast recovery, slow start, double
<BR>
initial MSS, window scaling and SAK, etc. are a long way down that road
<BR>
paved with good intentions.  Start adding neat knobs to the API, and TCP
<BR>
will instantly flash under the lintel with the damning motto.
