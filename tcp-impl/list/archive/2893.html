From: MUYI IGE
<BR>
Dear Sir,
<BR>
I am Muyiwa Ige, the second surviving son of the late Justice Bola
<BR>
Ige.
<BR>
We hereby acknowledge the receipt of your mail to my mother with
<BR>
thanks, May God reward you greatly for your decision to assist us in
<BR>
this mutually beneficial transaction; 
<BR>
It is important that I deal with you directly at this crucial Stage
<BR>
in this issue rather than the family lawyer.
<BR>
As my mother has rightly informed you, we are seriously in distress
<BR>
as all our saved money abroad totaling over US$700M has been
<BR>
confiscated by the Nigerian Government as part of the probe into the
<BR>
Nigeria Electric Power Authority (N.EP.A.), headed by my Father as a
<BR>
Sole Administrator, a few months before he was assassinated on
<BR>
Wednesday, 26th December, 2001 by unknown gunmen in our Family home.
<BR>
<P>If you have been following my family's profile in the news lately,
<BR>
you would have read about the assassination.
<BR>
I wish to inform you that my mother reached you based on the fact
<BR>
that she would really want us to establish a relationship based on
<BR>
mutual trust and understanding.
<BR>
So many people have disappointed us home and abroad, even people who
<BR>
benefited from my father, have all bitten the finger that once fed
<BR>
them, that is why we had to throw caution to the wind and trust you a
<BR>
stranger who we had never met all our lives.
<BR>
Dear Friend, as much as we recognize that a lot of wonders happen
<BR>
these days,
<BR>
you do not have to doubt the authenticity of my mothers mail to you,
<BR>
because we are really oppressed, and we need the assistance of a God
<BR>
fearing person and a good natured man to help us clear our funds from
<BR>
a security company, and bank it up for us while we make arrangements
<BR>
to travel and join you up as soon as the shipment is effected.
<BR>
For security purposes, I shall be coordinating the Business
<BR>
transaction as my mother is currently in distress and we cannot
<BR>
afford to Lose this only remaining $40,300,000:00/m of all that my
<BR>
father left for us. At the moment, the funds are in a security
<BR>
company and were deposited as Photographic materials in some luggage.
<BR>
As soon as we are sure that we can trust you, we shall go ahead to
<BR>
send you the Certificate of deposit and the luggage numbers and
<BR>
security code numbers.
<BR>
For the purpose of security and confidentiality, I would require that
<BR>
You and I proceed with this business with telephone and fax
<BR>
communication, as I would not want to discuss this transaction on The
<BR>
Internet for security reasons.
<BR>
So I would suggest that we conduct this business through telephone
<BR>
and fax communication, while my mother will be reaching you via
<BR>
e-mail as security agents bug her telephone line often.
<BR>
As, as soon as I hear from, I shall furnish you with the whole
<BR>
details of how to Finalize the transaction and other information you
<BR>
might require or other things you might need to know and also you
<BR>
should be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free and
<BR>
success guaranteed.
<BR>
There are documents backing the legitimacy of this transaction that
<BR>
will convince your bank or any other bank that might doubt the
<BR>
authenticity of these funds.
<BR>
Also I will send you more information and other information you might
<BR>
require via fax immediately I hear from you on telephone.
<BR>
I look forward to your urgent response, as my mother and the rest of
<BR>
my immediate family genuinely need your help.
<BR>
Truly Yours,
<BR>
<P>MUYI IGE
<BR>
