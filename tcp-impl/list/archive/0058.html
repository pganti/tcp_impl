<P>
<EM>&gt; notice the series of RSTs.  This is for each packet that was 'on its way'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when the client aborted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is these RSTs which cause the server's write() to return with an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error, ie connection reset by peer...
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we're all in agreement that the above is exactly what is
<BR>
supposed to happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem that occurs with a bad stack is that the server side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application will hang forever without the RSTs.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I haven't quite been able to get a handle on (until below) is
<BR>
just who has the bad stack (client or server), and in what way it is
<BR>
bad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2C. Client aborts and sends either a FIN or RST 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	(lets say a FIN to show the problem, and reasons for RST instead)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3C. The client application has destroyed the socket, and it detached
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  	from the stack for that connection. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	From the client stack side, the connection no longer exists
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3S Server continues to be in a write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Server Stack goes to CLOSE_WAIT ( having received the FIN )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4S Server will continue to write to the client, until it has exhausted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    its window. This is OK for a half-close.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5S The window is exhausted, and the server will wait until the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    opens the window. (window probes )
</EM><BR>
<P>To be perfectly precise, the server won't &quot;wait&quot;; it should send
<BR>
periodic probes. So in this case the server is still sending TCP
<BR>
segments.  If it really is waiting for the client to send it
<BR>
something, the server stack is broken.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4C. The client should, but doesnt  send a RST upon receiving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	 remaining data from the server or window probes.
</EM><BR>
<P>The client is clearly broken, and in a major way that just doesn't
<BR>
make sense to me. In step 3C, the client has destroyed the
<BR>
connection. Yet in step 4C, when the client gets a TCP segment for
<BR>
which it doesn't have a control block, it does nothing, as opposed to
<BR>
sending a RST.
<BR>
<P>The client stack needs to be fixed; the fix is to follow the TCP spec,
<BR>
which has nothing to do with whether it issued a half-duplex close or
<BR>
not.  Just what stack has this property, i.e., doesn't send RSTs when
<BR>
receiving a TCP segment for which it has no associated connection?
<BR>
This is majorly broken.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By [having the client] sending a RST instead of the FIN to abort the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection, we can cause both the server side and client side stacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to tear the connection down immediately, and avoid the half-close
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where it gets caught.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a hack that doesn't completely fix the problem. If the RST is
<BR>
lost, you have the same problem as before. It seems to me that the
<BR>
client stack needs to send RSTs like called for in the spec.
<BR>
