<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; You don't need 32 bits of true randomness per ISN.  Once you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; 128 bits of true randomness you can safely get trillions of ISNs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; That statement sounds highly dubious to me.  What are your grounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for making it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take that 128 bits of true ranodmness and use it as the key for AES
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running in counter mode.  I believe it's accepted that about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2^{128/3} blocks of output will be indistinguishable from truely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; random data by attacker who cannot break the cipher in use.
</EM><BR>
<P>You may well believe it.  But what are your grounds?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Have you looked at the Yarrow paper I gave a link to?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P>First, www.counterpane.com suffers from the &quot;won't frag&quot; disease; it
<BR>
sends packets with DF set but either never receives or refuses to
<BR>
listen to the need-frag unreachables my gateway is sending back.
<BR>
<P>When I located a machine I could use that wasn't behind this gateway,
<BR>
the URL you gave proved to be for a tiny (about three pages) blurb, not
<BR>
a paper of any sort.  It did include a link to
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.counterpane.com/yarrow-notes.html">http://www.counterpane.com/yarrow-notes.html</A>, which contained an
<BR>
abstract and two links, one claiming to be PDF and the other claiming
<BR>
to be PostScript, neither of which is a format that normally contains
<BR>
readable text.  (I didn't actually download either to check; I assumed
<BR>
the descriptions were accurate.)
<BR>
<P>Do you wish to name that paper as the &quot;grounds&quot; I asked for?  If so, it
<BR>
wasn't clear from your first message - perhaps I should try to coax
<BR>
something usable out of one of those formats.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; [...].  In theory, the attacker could even brute-force it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't understand how you can brute-force something in theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>As in, &quot;this is something which is theoretically possible but may not
<BR>
be practical (for unspecified reasons)&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it's practically infeasible to search the key space, there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to worry about.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except tomorrow's practice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And 128 bits Ought to be Enough for Everybody(TM).
</EM><BR>
<P>They said that about 640KB of RAM, too.  I've seen some disturbing
<BR>
rumblings on the horizon that imply that we may have to worry about
<BR>
nondeterminstic computers in the (so far only dimly) foreseeable
<BR>
future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; As for the attacker recognizing how you generate your ISNs, well, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; any crypto person will tell you, your security cannot, in more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the short term, rest on keeping your algorithms themselves secret.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You must be responding to somebody else's comments here.
</EM><BR>
<P>No; I was responding to
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; [...] without giving an attacker a chance to recognize you're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; using a true random number generator.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point is that you have to assume that the attacker *knows* exactly
<BR>
how you're generating the ISNs; all you can keep secret (except in that
<BR>
short term I mentioned), is the entropy you've accumulated.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess the short summary should be that cryptographers know how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make good PRNGs, and they even give them away into public domain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the other hands, non-cryptographers--predictably--have less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thorough understanding of producing cryptographically secure PRNGs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your phrasing sounds as though you intend this as some kind of attack
<BR>
on me as a non-cryptographer.  If so, I consider it flawed, because I
<BR>
am making no claim to producing any sort of PRNG; all I am pointing out
<BR>
is that if you haven't got the entropy, you just haven't got it, and
<BR>
you *are* then doing pseudo-random, rather than really random, values.
<BR>
And you are then pinning your security on trying to obscure that
<BR>
entropy enough that it's infeasible to deduce it from the generated
<BR>
values, even when you've theoretically leaked enough that it's shifted
<BR>
from &quot;impossible&quot; to &quot;difficult&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I suppose it comes down to the difference between &quot;infeasible&quot; (which
<BR>
is a moving target) and &quot;impossible&quot; (which isn't).
<BR>
<P>In any case, tcp-impl probably is not the right place for a crypto
<BR>
discussion.  If I write anything further on the crypto side of this, it
<BR>
will be off-list; the last public word can be yours, if you want it.
<BR>
