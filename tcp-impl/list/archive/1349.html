I was looking at some traces and noticed that the Slow Start 
<BR>
algorithm opens the window size by *one* segment size everytime 
<BR>
an ACK is received.  This is how it was described in Van Jacobson's 
<BR>
&quot;Congestion Avoidance and Control&quot; SIGCOM'98 paper.   Is there 
<BR>
any reason why it is designed this way as opposed to opening 
<BR>
the window by the amount of data that got acked?   With Delayed 
<BR>
Ack in effect,  the one-segment growth scheme would increase the 
<BR>
window in roughly 2^(x/2) way as opposed to a true 2^x growth.    
<BR>
Basically,  RTT*logW (where W is window size in segments) being 
<BR>
the time to reach steady state as computed in VJ's paper will 
<BR>
not be true for Delayed Ack.   And this will be even worse 
<BR>
for the stacks that are lazy about sending Acks i.e send one 
<BR>
Ack for more than 2 packets (please... i dont mean to re-start 
<BR>
last weeks discussion on this subject)
<BR>
<P>However,  a simple one-line fix to open the window by the amount of 
<BR>
data acked (ack - snd_una) should work well always.   The window would 
<BR>
still open exponentially and the time to reach full window size would 
<BR>
still be in the order of RTT*logW, approximately. 
<BR>
<P>Any reason why it shouldnt be done this way?
