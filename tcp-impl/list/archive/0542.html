<BR>
<P>Perry,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your main objection to the proposal to me, and please let me
<BR>
know if I'm interpreting your notes wrong, appears to be that
<BR>
some of the objects defined in the proposal make it easier for
<BR>
an attacker to gain access to TCP connections. I think I've
<BR>
attempted to explain that though security needs to be addressed
<BR>
that it shouldn't be the deciding factor in whether the objects
<BR>
exists or not. The security issue with respect to SNMP should
<BR>
not be the deciding factor. I do agree that it does effect how the
<BR>
objects are modeled and the platforms were they will be implemented.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of platforms have implemented their own secure SET support
<BR>
using SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 community strings while others have implemented
<BR>
SNMPv2u or SNMPv2*. Unfortunately, these solutions don't interoperate
<BR>
in general nor are they universally deployed. It looks like the SNMPv3
<BR>
working group is still on track to defining a standard in this
<BR>
area by the end of this year.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An extension to the TCP MIB needs to provide guidance with respect
<BR>
to whether SETs should be allowed or even if a certain set of objects
<BR>
should be retrievable but leave it up to its implementer to decide for
<BR>
their environment what is appropriate. The TCP/IP product that I work
<BR>
on didn't implement SET support for those objects defined by RFC1213
<BR>
until we could provide some way of insuring that the sets were secure.
<BR>
This didn't prevent for example MIB-2 defining tcpConnState as a
<BR>
read-write object nor all of the work being done in various working
<BR>
groups to enable remote creation and management. All of which cause
<BR>
large security problems if blindly implemented.
<BR>
<P>Regards, Ken
