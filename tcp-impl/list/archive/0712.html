<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What do you figure is the right response when an HTTP client sends a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; few redundant ACKs and then a FIN?   Isn't that what your &quot;big name&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; server with MTU discovery on and ICMP blocked will see?   How is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different from many other problems, starting with transient unidirectional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blackholes (e.g. routing problems) and continuing with data-dependent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; packet loss?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One approach is to be a bit smarter with MTU discovery - turn discovery off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on retransmits and if you see consistent cases of  transmit with DF, silence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmit without DF ack then to turn it off for good on that session.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does it mean to turn off MTU discovery on a session?  Do you mean
<BR>
to drop down to some random MSS that is smaller than both of the MSS's
<BR>
and the MTU's of the TCP peers?  Such as the old ~500, despite the
<BR>
performance hit?  Or some other ad hoc number such as 1500?
<BR>
<P>Do you do this on all retransmissions?  Do you do some kind of
<BR>
slow-increase on the MSS just in case misdiagnosed the problem?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Im not sure of a good way to tell that from getting the rtt wrong however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I'd like to hear suggestions. The obvious answer is to educate the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name site's firewall configuration folks. So far thats proving to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstration of the shortage of clueful people on the internet..
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure of a good way to tell broken MTU discovery from the
<BR>
typical broken PC-web-surfer.  I bet a lot of HTTP sessions wind down
<BR>
into dup-ACK...dup-ACK... as some ISP's terminal server tries to cope
<BR>
with sick modems and lame PC PPP code.
<BR>
<P><P>There is another tactic, &quot;let 'em fix the network.&quot;  It's not as if
<BR>
broken MTU discovery is the biggest or most common problem on the net
<BR>
today.
<BR>
<P><P>I care a little about this problem because of a persistent trickle of
<BR>
complaints about access to www.sgi.com by a few (but not all distant)
<BR>
clients with local FDDI rings .  Based on probes around the Internet
<BR>
from www.sgi.com, things are working fine within a bunch of hops of the
<BR>
machine.  I suspect there are random routers throughout the Internet
<BR>
that do not generate ICMP errors.  Or FDDI-Ethernet bridges such as
<BR>
some models of Cabletron and NPI.
