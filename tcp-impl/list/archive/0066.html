<P>
<EM>&gt; It doesn't make sense to have the client send out a reset, and yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still be in FIN_WAIT_2 state. If it sends a reset, the server is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposed to delete its end and stop sending anything else. What will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the client out of the FIN_WAIT_2 state (normally, it is a FIN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the server!)?
</EM><BR>
We're talking about two different things here.
<BR>
The problem occurs when the client send a FIN to abort a connection
<BR>
ie, user hits 'stop'.  In this case we go to FIN_WAIT_2 ( as well as
<BR>
the other prior states ). 
<BR>
<P>The workaround has been that the web client forces the stack to send
<BR>
a RST, avoiding the later states, and the hang problem.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I really don't see this as a big issue. I'd venture that in the vast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of cases, at the exect time the client half-duplex closes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection, there will be no received data queued by TCP (at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receiver), so this scenario won't happen frequently in practice. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is absolutely critical, however, is that any subsequent TCP packets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that arrive for that connection cause a RST to be generated.
</EM><BR>
Actually, its a trememdously big issue, and it happens more often than
<BR>
many peopl think, in terms of the web.
<BR>
( yes yes, HTTP is evil for TCP )
<BR>
With HTTP virtually *any* time the client is the active closer,
<BR>
it is in an interrupt case.  The server almost *always* has 
<BR>
data to send afterwards.
<BR>
<P>Think about it:
<BR>
<P>case 1:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page is taking too long, I hit stop.  Sooner or later
<BR>
the server is going to get around to sending the requested page.
<BR>
It will probably send a series of packets before it receives
<BR>
my clients first RST. 
<BR>
(the client will end up sending RSTs for a whole bunch of packets,
<BR>
more on slower links where there is more data 'in the pipe', and 
<BR>
guess what, there are *plenty* of people on slow links and dialup lines)
<BR>
<P>case 2:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im 'joe surfer'  I dont even let the page finish loading
<BR>
before I make my next click.  This is virtually the same as hitting
<BR>
stop, except that now the client goes on to load the next page.
<BR>
If I do a series of these, I have aborted many connections.
<BR>
Eventually Ill get to a page I want, then Ill read it, which
<BR>
takes a long time relatively speaking.
<BR>
<P>So for 20 connections, 5 links traveled, 4 gifs on each, I
<BR>
aborted 16 out of 20 connections.  Each aborted connection
<BR>
was a case where the server did have data to send.
<BR>
<P>In both cases, it isnt just one connection, but multple concurrent
<BR>
connections for each gif on the page, up to the browsers max 
<BR>
concurrent limit.
<BR>
