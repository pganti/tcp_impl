<EM>&gt;&gt; ...  We have never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; seen any problem with this assumption, and add the window scale option to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; every active connection request.  Has anyone had a problem with this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Absolutely!  In our first attempt to support this option, we always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sent it.  Big mistake!  Almost immediately we got field reports
</EM><BR>
.....
<BR>
<P>Were these &quot;dinosaurs&quot; or were they new systems with stacks that
<BR>
had been, shall we say, &quot;shipped before their time&quot;?
<BR>
<P>If it was the latter, you were blamed for someone elses bug, because
<BR>
you were in the minority: you were trying to be aggressive about new
<BR>
features.
<BR>
<P>This phenomena is a huge drag on implementing and deploying new TCP
<BR>
features.  We as an industry (as a WG?) have got to find a way to
<BR>
defend correct new TCP implementations from clueless network
<BR>
administrators insisting on compatibility with busted code.
<BR>
<P>If nothing else, tcpimpl could recommend putting all of these backward
<BR>
compatibility features under runtime switchs.  It would be really nice
<BR>
if tcpimpl could document (and even standardize switch names for) some
<BR>
of the popular workarounds.  Thus, when the clueless network
<BR>
administrator was told by the third new system vendor to &quot;set
<BR>
tcp_backward_conservative_winshift&quot;) the administrator might correctly
<BR>
place the blame.
<BR>
<P>Note that SACK will also discover stacks that die on unexpected SYN
<BR>
options.  Perhaps some of the vendors who have SACK in the field might
<BR>
comment?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some do not even have a meaningful sb_max
</EM><BR>
True, I guess &quot;preferred winshift&quot; should have it's own knob.
<BR>
