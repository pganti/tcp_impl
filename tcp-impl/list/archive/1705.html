<EM>&gt; You propose modifying sender behavior so that cooperating receivers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could improve throughput.  Could we achieve the same thing purely within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the receiver?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure.  It would certainly be desirable but I haven't been able
<BR>
to think of a _simple_ way of doing it and that is an important criteria
<BR>
for me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So let's think about those conditions: low packet loss, high throughput,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typically corresponds to LAN latencies or at least large open window.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about just causing the receiver to never delay ACK if more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `threshold' time has elapsed since the last ACK sent by the receiver?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly `threshold' would be &lt; 200ms; I'm thinking around 100ms or 50ms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wouldn't this be bad for slow, high latency connections?   This would
<BR>
effectively switch off delayed-ack altogether since it wouldn't be
<BR>
too hard to have a connection where the inter-packet-arrival time at
<BR>
the receiver is greater than 50ms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it is much less than sender's RTO interval, then receiver would effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suppress delayed ACK *without* the sender signaling that in an option bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can the receiver know the sender's RTO?  It could estimate it, but I
<BR>
can't think of any simple mechanism that would give a reliable enough
<BR>
estimate.  Time between acking byte x and receiving byte x+1 wouldn't
<BR>
work because the receiver can't be sure that the sender's congestion
<BR>
window is such that sending byte x+1 requires byte x being acked.
<BR>
<P>I would want to avoid any excessive complexity in the TCP stack since
<BR>
this is bad for low network latency, high bandwidth situations where
<BR>
performance is CPU and memory-access speed bound.
<BR>
<P>The simplicity of the `slow-start-bit' appeals to me.  I don't know
<BR>
how big of an issue the implementations using the reserved bits that
<BR>
David brough up is.  This would also be an issue for ECN then.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Sam.
