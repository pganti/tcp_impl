</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What bad things happen if you use completely predictable ISN's?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You've fixed your systems to not use IP addresses as authenticators
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by turning off /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts, right?  So what if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bad guy predicts all of your ISN's?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The bad guy could, for example, relay spam through your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PIPELINE-enabled ESMTP server--in an almost untraceable manner.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure I agree that predicting ISN's would be sufficient to get
<BR>
through typical SMTP relay criteria.  I definitiely do not agree with
<BR>
&quot;untraceable,&quot; because of the defenses that have evolved against other
<BR>
forged IP-source address attacks.  Then there is the fact that in most of
<BR>
a decade of trying, not one spammer has been found that can forge a
<BR>
believable Received: line, despite the absolutely trivial effort needed.
<BR>
I doubt you could find a spammer or spamware author capable of
<BR>
understanding the concept &quot;TCP initial sequence number&quot; or even &quot;TCP
<BR>
sequence number.&quot;  However, assume predictable ISN's would have spammers
<BR>
relaying untraceable spam.  So what?  I've have and continue to do far
<BR>
more about email spam than the vast majority (I'm sure including you),
<BR>
but even I know relaying or even sending spam is not a serious enough
<BR>
problem to justify even one line of kernel code.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Or they could abuse some CGI scripts, and you would not know who they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you're smart enough to turn off .rhosts, then let's hope you have not
<BR>
made the gross blunder of using IP addresses as authenticators for your
<BR>
CGI scripts or the infinite number of similar stupid mistakes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;       Or they could try exploits on your TCP services without an easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to learn who they were.
</EM><BR>
<P>Never mind that most of those who worry about bad guys trying exploits
<BR>
on their TCP services, often using misnamed (actually, fraudulently named)
<BR>
&quot;personal firewalls&quot; have been such pests with their silly false alarms
<BR>
that reports of attacks are now routinely ignored.
<BR>
Predictable ISN's do little or nothing to ensure that you can find or
<BR>
identify attackers.  Consider that the serious, real life attacks in the
<BR>
last year or two that have involved forged IP source addresses.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Given the fact that good PRNGs are cheap (just some 50 cycles or so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; per ISN), there's no excuse to not use them.
</EM><BR>
<P>No one is suggesting not using enough entropy and suitable software to
<BR>
generate ISN's that cannot in practice be guessed, because it is
<BR>
sufficiently cheap.  On the other hand, I suspect that 50 CPU cycles is
<BR>
ridiculously low for your Yarrow-160, what with its use of 3-DES and SHA.
<BR>
I don't think you can even meet 50 cycles by fetching the clock and running
<BR>
it and other secrets through MD5, or equivalents that I've coded and
<BR>
shipped.
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry to be raining on security audit expert parades (oh, not really),
<BR>
but predictable ISN's are not a major problem, no matter how many trade
<BR>
rag consultants, netnews experts, and salescritters tell their marks
<BR>
otherwise.
