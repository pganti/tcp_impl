<P>
RFC 2001 is a proposed standard that defines TCP congestion control, namely
<BR>
the specifics of slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and
<BR>
fast recovery.  We (meaning Allyn, Steve &amp; I) have been discussing the need
<BR>
to revise it and have agreed that (1) it needs revision, and (2) tcp-impl
<BR>
is an appropriate forum for developing the revision.  Rich Stevens (author
<BR>
of 2001) has agreed to do the necessary editing to revise it, based on
<BR>
input from tcp-impl.
<BR>
<P>The need for revision comes for two reasons.  The first is that, in its
<BR>
present form, 2001 standardizes on exactly the Reno algorithms.  For some
<BR>
aspects of congestion control, this is overly stringent.  For example,
<BR>
there are a number of TCPs that during congestion avoidance count how much
<BR>
data has been acked and increase cwnd by one segment after successfully
<BR>
sending cwnd's worth of data.  This differs from the &quot;cwnd += MSS*MSS/cwnd&quot;
<BR>
algorithm used by Reno, though the differences are minor.  We would not want
<BR>
to consider these TCPs as failing to be standard-compliant.
<BR>
<P>The other reason for revision is that there appears to be widespread
<BR>
support for increasing the initial value of cwnd beyond its present value
<BR>
of a single segment, up to two segments (at least; see below).  This
<BR>
improves performance, both by getting data sent more quickly, and by
<BR>
avoiding a potentially lengthy delay if the receiver only acks the first
<BR>
segment using a delayed ack.
<BR>
<P>Two pragmatic arguments that it's okay to start with two segments are:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) TCPs are constantly sending two back-to-back packets anyway -
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever ack-every-other is used, and always during slow-start.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the net already puts up with pretty much exactly this load
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyway.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Plenty of TCPs already start in some circumstances with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an initial window of two segments, due to bugs or design.
<BR>
<P>So starting with two rather than one is only a lose when the net is so
<BR>
loaded that it can only sustain a single packet in flight per connection;
<BR>
and you quickly get to that state anyway, when the second packet is lost,
<BR>
just as you would after one RTT if you started cwnd at one segment,
<BR>
<P>Note that the proposed change only affects the initial slow-start, not
<BR>
slow-start after loss.
<BR>
<P>Sally Floyd, Mark Allman and Craig Partridge have an I-D that discusses
<BR>
increasing the initial cwnd to two segments or possibly more (which is
<BR>
potentially more controversial).  I haven't seen an official announcement
<BR>
of it yet, but it's unofficially available from:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://gigahertz.lerc.nasa.gov/~mallman/papers/draft-floyd-incr-init-win-00.txt">http://gigahertz.lerc.nasa.gov/~mallman/papers/draft-floyd-incr-init-win-00.txt</A>
<BR>
<P>Our plan is to begin work on revising 2001 in tcp-impl in parallel with the
<BR>
development of their I-D.  For now, we will assume that the initial cwnd
<BR>
change will be to start with two segments.  If down the line the I-D
<BR>
successfully establishes a different initial value, it is straight-forward
<BR>
to amend the 2001 revision accordingly.
<BR>
<P>This will be an agenda topic at Munich.  I'm hoping that we can have some
<BR>
fruitful discussion of it beforehand on the mailing list.
<BR>
<P>A final comment: a key point is that our primary goal is to clarify RFC 2001,
<BR>
not to overhaul it.  For example, I'm predisposed against revising it so that
<BR>
during slow-start cwnd is opened by the amount of data acked, rather than
<BR>
one segment per ack (as we discussed earlier on the list), as this is a change
<BR>
that will significantly alter TCP burstiness compared to how it works in
<BR>
the net today.  I would also have considered increasing the initial cwnd
<BR>
out of scope, were it not that there appears widespread consensus that going
<BR>
to two segments is okay, and an I-D in the works thoroughly exploring the
<BR>
issues.
<BR>
