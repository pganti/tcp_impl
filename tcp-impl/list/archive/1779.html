Hello,
<BR>
<P>While simulating TCP, I found that the receiver window (rwnd) prevents
<BR>
sometimes the source from sending new packets during the recovery phase.
<BR>
This happens when the inflated congestion window (cwnd) exceeds rwnd.
<BR>
First, this causes bursts at the end of the recovery phase which
<BR>
overwhelms network buffers. Second, this causes low throughput during
<BR>
Fast Recovery. Third, in case of Reno, this may prohibit the source from
<BR>
correcting the second loss in a window (Reno cannot correct more than
<BR>
two losses).
<BR>
<P>It is true that when cwnd = rwnd (suppose that the source has enough
<BR>
data to fully utilize its window), the receiver buffer is full. But, we
<BR>
know that when the retransmission is received, some places will be
<BR>
emptied in this receiver. So we can follow the retransmission with some
<BR>
new packets (a kind of anticipation). If these packets find places in
<BR>
the buffer, our anticipation succeeds. Otherwise some packets will be
<BR>
rejected and we can simply suppose at the source that these packets are
<BR>
not transmitted.
<BR>
<P>Such anticipation requires to change the condition : take the minimum of
<BR>
cwnd and rwnd and try to transmit new data. Why to not inflate the rwnd
<BR>
along with cwnd during Fast Recovery? When a dupack is received, we
<BR>
increase rwnd by one segment as we do with cwnd. When a partial ACK is
<BR>
received, we deflate rwnd and set it again to the real window advertised
<BR>
by the receiver. Concerning the maximum sequence number transmitted, we
<BR>
set to it &quot; snd_unack + rwnd - 1 &quot; (of course if the actual maximum
<BR>
sequence number is larger than this quantity). 
<BR>
<P>snd_unack : the highest sequence number acked.
<BR>
<P>I think that transmitting more packets that the receiver window (during
<BR>
a short period) doesn't violate TCP congestion control. No more load is
<BR>
injected in the network than in the case of large rwnd.
<BR>
<P>Your feedback is very welcome
<BR>
