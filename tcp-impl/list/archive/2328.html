Dear all,
<BR>
<P>I have a question regarding the ECN as specified in RFC2481. In
<BR>
Section 5, page 4 it is stated that:
<BR>
<P>[..]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we do not recommend such behavior as the slow-start of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahoe TCP in response to a packet drop, or Reno TCP's wait of roughly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half a round-trip time during Fast Recovery
<BR>
[..]
<BR>
<P><P>The problem I have w/ it is that, as stated in section 6.1.2, the
<BR>
sender will half its cwnd (and set ssthresh) upon the receipt of an
<BR>
ECN-Echo ACK. But assuming that ACK-clocking was running and we
<BR>
didn't have any losses in the last RTT we have a full cwnd of data
<BR>
outstanding at the time we receive this ECN-Echo ACK. By halving the cwnd
<BR>
we still have to wait half a RTT (alternatively: wait for enough ACKs
<BR>
accounting for half of cwnd of data to arrive to decrease the amount of
<BR>
outstanding data to cwnd/2) before the  sender is allowed to transmit more
<BR>
data. 
<BR>
<P>With many thanks,
<BR>
<P>Florian.
<BR>
<P><P>P.S:  Maybe that I am wrong, but my reasoning behind &quot;Reno was to wait
<BR>
half a RTT before sending more&quot; data was similar (though in a different
<BR>
situation): We had to inflate cwnd back to at least its original size
<BR>
(i.e. when loss was signaled e.g. by 3 dup ACKs) before transmitting
<BR>
anything new and that meant waiting cwnd/2 worth of dup ACKs &lt;=&gt; half
<BR>
a RTT.
