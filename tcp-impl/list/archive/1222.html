&nbsp;how can people find you to buy your products 
<BR>
&nbsp;or services?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;* Over 90% of Internet Users Utilize Search

&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;For just $39.95 we'll take the work load off your
<BR>
&nbsp;back instead of you trying to do it manually which
<BR>
&nbsp;can take hours upon hours and even days to do.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;We're the professionals that are here to help
<BR>
&nbsp;you have a shot at having a successful marketing
<BR>
&nbsp;experience with the internet.
<BR>
<P>Your web site will be available to be see by millions
<BR>
and millions of prospects. 
<BR>
<P>It's true what the old saying says  - &quot;no one 
<BR>
ever sees a candle that's hidden under a basket.&quot;  
<BR>
It's the same for your web site.  
<BR>
<P>*  Is your web site hidden under a basket?
<BR>
<P>*  Can prospects easily find your web site?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From one business person to another, let me
</EM><BR>
ask this question - If prospects can't find your 
<BR>
web site, then how do you expect to make any
<BR>
money from it ???  You Can't....
<BR>
<P>You'll be amazed at how easy it is to immediately
<BR>
get the kind of exposure your web site needs to 
<BR>
be successful.
<BR>
<P>Who uses our service?
<BR>
<P>Universities, Colleges, Medical Facilities,
<BR>
Government Facilities, Trade Bureaus, Chambers
<BR>
Of Commerce, Travel Agents/Agencies, An Enormous
<BR>
Variety Of On-line Shops Selling Everything Kind
<BR>
Of Product, Service, Or Information You Can Imagine,
<BR>
Hotels, Motels, Bed &amp; Breakfasts, Vacation Spots.
<BR>
The List Goes On And On...
<BR>
<P>A good question you might be asking yourself is
<BR>
&quot;Why should I pay these guys even 5 cents to
<BR>
do this? Can't I do it myself?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The answer is - sure you can but let me
<BR>
ask you this - 
<BR>
<P>Isn't your time worth more than 5 cents???
<BR>
<P>It sure had better be !!!
<BR>
<P>You know as well as I that your time is
<BR>
best utilized managing your business and not
<BR>
sitting at some keyboard hours upon hours
<BR>
trying to save less than 5 cents for each  
<BR>
submission. See how it's kind of crazy to try
<BR>
to tackle this on your own.  It's just not 
<BR>
cost effective to try to do this yourself.
<BR>
<P>Not to mention that you will be totally nuts 
<BR>
within 2 days of attempting to do this and 
<BR>
you'll be pulling your hair out and wanting
<BR>
to throw your keyboard across the room :-)
<BR>
<P>Another good question you might be asking is
<BR>
&quot;OK, this almost sounds too good to be true.
<BR>
I've seen other companies that charge several
<BR>
hundred dollars for this type of service and
<BR>
you're telling me that you can do it for only
<BR>
$39.95?&quot; What's the catch ???
<BR>
<P>There isn't one...
<BR>
<P>We have invested thousands and thousands of 
<BR>
dollars into state-of-the-art equipment and custom
<BR>
software which makes this all manageable.  As a 
<BR>
matter of fact, we are so fully automated that we 
<BR>
can handle several thousand submissions per day.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ORDER FORM
<BR>
==========================
<BR>
<P><P>Place an &quot;X&quot; by the level of service you want:
<BR>
<P>Why different levels?  You will find that over time
<BR>
your web site will just &quot;Disappear&quot; from some
<BR>
search engines, directories and indexes.  The 
<BR>
reason for this varies from each one but the
<BR>
fact remains that your site will just DROP
<BR>
OFF THE LIST.  That is why it is important
<BR>
to be sure to resubmit your site on occasion.
<BR>
<P>Our most popular package is the 4 times
<BR>
submission package because it provides
<BR>
you with a complete submission to all the
<BR>
search engines, directories and index we
<BR>
use EVERY THREE MONTHS for a full year.  Our 
<BR>
clients who are professional webmasters for 
<BR>
others recommend this to their own clients.  
<BR>
They also tend to use this level themselves.
<BR>
<P>_____  1 time submission, $ 39.95
<BR>
We submit your web site one time. This 
<BR>
program is considered &quot;FAIR&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>_____  2 times submission, $ 59.95
<BR>
We submit your web site once immediately
<BR>
and again in 6 months. This program is 
<BR>
considered &quot;GOOD&quot;
<BR>
<P>_____  3 times submission, $ 79.95
<BR>
We submit your web site once immediately
<BR>
and again in 6 months and again in 9
<BR>
months. This program is considered 
<BR>
&quot;BETTER&quot;
<BR>
<P>****************************************
<BR>
This is our most popular program
<BR>
<P>_____  4 times submission, $ 99.95
<BR>
We submit your web site once immediately
<BR>
and then once each 3 months for one year.
<BR>
This program is considered &quot; B E S T &quot; and
<BR>
is used by most professional webmasters.
<BR>
It is our most popular selection.
<BR>
****************************************
<BR>
<P>_____ 12 times submission, $259.95
<BR>
We submit your site monthly for an entire
<BR>
year.  This program is considered &quot;Overkill 
<BR>
for most.&quot; This should be used by businesses
<BR>
that are selling large ticket items where the loss
<BR>
of a single sale outweighs the increased
<BR>
cost of this package.
<BR>
<P>KEYWORDS:
<BR>
<P>What are keywords or key phrases?  These are
<BR>
the words that people will enter into the search 
<BR>
engines to try to find your type of product or 
<BR>
service.  So, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you think
<BR>
carefully about what words your prospects will
<BR>
use to try to find you.
<BR>
<P>An example would be, if you sell paint, then 
<BR>
paint should be one of your key words.  If you 
<BR>
sell cessna airplanes, then aircraft, airplane,
<BR>
aviation, and cessna would be keywords that 
<BR>
you would want to use. 
<BR>
<P>You can also use &quot;Key Phrases.&quot;  This is like 
<BR>
the words, ski resort, mountain hiking, medical
<BR>
facilities, travel agency, etc.
<BR>
<P>You can list up to 16 keywords or keyword 
<BR>
phrases.  Note: Keyword phrases count as one
<BR>
word but don't get carried away with that idea.
<BR>
<P>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING
<BR>
A KEY PHRASE AS WE CAN'T USE IT;
<BR>
mountain hiking biking skiing surfing scuba
<BR>
<P>Keep your key phrases limited to 2-3 words 
<BR>
max.  They must match what your prospect will
<BR>
be typing in to find you.
<BR>
<P>Many of the search engines will take your list 
<BR>
of keywords and they will place the most emphasis
<BR>
( importance ) on the first word in the list and 
<BR>
then give less importance to the 2nd word then 
<BR>
less to the 3rd word and so forth with the least 
<BR>
amount of importance given to the 16th word.  
<BR>
Therefore, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you list 
<BR>
them in the order of #1 being THE MOST 
<BR>
IMPORTANT, then number 2 being less 
<BR>
important than #1 but more important than 
<BR>
#3 etc.
<BR>
<P>List them from 1 to 16 in the order of most 
<BR>
important being #1 to the least important being 
<BR>
#16.  Key words can be two words i.e. ski 
<BR>
vacation, or hospital room, or Dallas Texas.

<P><P>TITLE OF YOUR WEB PAGE:
<BR>
<P>What is the title of your web page?  These are the 
<BR>
words that will appear at the VERY TOP of your 
<BR>
internet browsers window.  Go to a particular
<BR>
site and you can see it for yourself.  It is at the 
<BR>
Very Top of your screen assuming that your 
<BR>
browser is taking up the full screen of your 
<BR>
monitor. 
<BR>
<P>The title is not to be taken lightly.  Search 
<BR>
engines often times will use this information as 
<BR>
well to help position your site in the list of 
<BR>
others that come up when people are searching for
<BR>
your products or services. 
<BR>
<P>Your company name is important but often not as 
<BR>
important as including some of your keywords in 
<BR>
the title.  For example, if you did sell Cessna 
<BR>
aircraft, a good title might be like this:
<BR>
<P>Cessna Aircraft - aircraft sales and service. 
<BR>
Johnson Aircraft, Los Angeles.
<BR>
<P>Title of Your Web Page (Create one if you don't
<BR>
have one - 10 words max)
<BR>
<P><P>Title: __________________________________________
<BR>
<P>_________________________________________________
<BR>
<P><P><P>Web Site Description:
<BR>
<P>What is a web site description?  This is one to
<BR>
two sentences telling people about your web 
<BR>
site, your company, and what you offer.  This
<BR>
will appear in many search engines as a &quot;snap
<BR>
shot&quot; as to what your site is about.
<BR>
<P>Your web site description is limited to 25 words
<BR>
or less.  Here is how you fill out the form below.
<BR>
Take a piece of paper and write down what you 
<BR>
want your sites description to be (like 
<BR>
mentioned above).  Once you are happy with 
<BR>
your 1-2 sentences, then take each of the words
<BR>
and place them in the spaces provided below.  
<BR>
Put the first word of your sentence in spot #1, 
<BR>
the second word in spot #2, the 3rd word in spot 
<BR>
#3, and so on until you have completed all 
<BR>
25 spots.
