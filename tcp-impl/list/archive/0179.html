<P>
Vern and Der Mouse are correct in their understanding of this problem.
<BR>
The sending TCP MUST set the PSH bit in the last segment that drains 
<BR>
the output queue. Apparently, Berkeley derived TCPs always pass 
<BR>
received input immediately to an application regardless of the PSH 
<BR>
bit. TCPs that don't immediately pass the input must rely on the PSH 
<BR>
bit to deliver data to an application or the connection is deadlocked.
<BR>
Passing data immediately upon receipt, or inventing a timer to push 
<BR>
the data to the application is not a good idea for large servers that 
<BR>
support 10s of thousands of connections.

<BR>
<EM>&gt;What concerns me is that some of this discussion has seemed to imply that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trace showing a sender which almost never turns on the PSH bit somehow
</EM><BR>
implies
<BR>
<EM>&gt;that there is something wrong with the sender implementation.  This is
</EM><BR>
clearly
<BR>
<EM>&gt;not true.  If the sender is faster than the receiver, meaning that the sender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;always has unsent data ready to go, then there is no obligation to turn on
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;PSH bit until the FIN goes out. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You are correct. What I meant to imply was that the sending TCP must set
<BR>
the PSH 
<BR>
bit in the last segment that drains the output queue. In fact, a sending
<BR>
TCP NEVER 
<BR>
has to set the PSH bit since the FIN implies a push.  
<BR>
<P>jt also writes:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;If there really is a receiver that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;refuse to send any data upstream until it sees a PSH bit, and will in fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let its receive window shrink to zero as a result, then I hope we can all
</EM><BR>
agree
<BR>
<EM>&gt;that this is a receiver problem, not a sender problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was not the problem. The receivers receive window never shrunk. The
<BR>
receiver had no data to send. The receiver was waiting for the PSH or
<BR>
enough
<BR>
data to fill the receive buffer before giving it to the application. The
<BR>
local 
<BR>
application couldn't send data until it had received the data TCP was
<BR>
sitting on.
