<P>
I'm confusing the same word of socket.
<BR>
<P>According to RFC 793:
<BR>
<P>To allow for many processes within a single host to use communication 
<BR>
facilities simultaneously, TCP provides a set of ports. A host machine 
<BR>
can support multiple ports, and each port has its own unique port number 
<BR>
within the host. A socket is formed from a concatenation of the port 
<BR>
number and a network address. The socket is a unique identifier 
<BR>
throughout all networks connected together.
<BR>
<P>A pair of sockets specifies the two end points and uniquely identifies 
<BR>
each connection. That is, a socket may be simultaneously used in multiple 
<BR>
connections. Therefore a server is capable of handling many clients at 
<BR>
the same time. The server's unique socket address is accessed 
<BR>
simultaneously by all of its clients. Since data segments for 
<BR>
a particular transport connection is always identified by both network 
<BR>
addresses and both ports, it is easy for a server to keep track of multiple 
<BR>
client connections.
<BR>
<P>The binding of ports to processes is handled independently by each host. 
<BR>
However, it proves useful to attach frequently used processes to fixed 
<BR>
sockets which are made known to the public. These services can then be 
<BR>
accessed through the known addresses called well-known ports.
<BR>
<P>Therefore a socket number can be associated with multiple remote sockets.
<BR>
<P>------
<BR>
<P>But according to the socket interface, 
<BR>
<P>result = socket (pf, type, protocol)
<BR>
<P><P>My questions are 
<BR>
<P>1. the above socket number is the 'result' value?
<BR>
<P>2. do the same word of 'socket' have the same semantics?
<BR>
<P>3. when a server port is shared by multiple connections, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do corresponding server sockets in view of socket interface have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same 'result' value? or different 'result' values?
<BR>
<P>Please fix my confusions.
