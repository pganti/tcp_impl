Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question concerning TCP behaviour. Current TCP implementations
<BR>
resort to a timeout when a retransmitted packet is lost. Consider the following
<BR>
behaviour for TCP Reno:
<BR>
<P>Sender transmits packets 1, 2, ... 10. Packet 1 gets lost. The retransmission
<BR>
of packet 1 upon getting 3 duplicate ACKs also gets lost. The duplicate ACKs
<BR>
generated due to packets 5 - 10 cause the sender to send new packets (11
<BR>
- 15). These packets would generate duplicate ACKs again in response to which
<BR>
the sender would send packets 16 - 20.  This would go on till the advertised
<BR>
window is exhausted and then the sender waits for a retransmission timeout.
<BR>
<P>There are some other observations that can be made here wrt congestion control.
<BR>
If any of the new packets generated also get lost, then the number of duplicate
<BR>
ACKs received by the sender get correspondingly reduced. The sender would
<BR>
correspondingly send less number of new segments. Thus further losses during
<BR>
fast recovery cause the injected data to be reduced &quot;linearly&quot; and not
<BR>
&quot;multiplicatively&quot;. Secondly, the long wait for retransmission timeouts can be
<BR>
detrimental for performance on high bandwidth networks.
<BR>
<P>The sender can easily detect loss of a retransmitted segment by counting the
<BR>
number of duplicate ACKs received (if more than 9 are received, then the
<BR>
sender can assume that the retransmitted packet was also lost). The sender
<BR>
can immediately go over to slow start rather than waiting for a retransmission
<BR>
timeout. The purpose of a retransmission timeout - clearing packets in the
<BR>
network - can also be achieved by slow-start.
<BR>
<P>I'd be glad to know opinions about this.
