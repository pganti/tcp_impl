<EM>&gt; I talked with Van about slow-start after idle issues.  His basic argument is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any time you've lost the ack clock, you need to recover it, and the mechanism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for doing so is a slow-start.  So after 1 RTO (at which point you don't expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any more feedback from the receiver), you need to begin a new slow-start, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as though you were beginning a new connection.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does slow-start after idle adjust the RTO at all (say, start timer backoff)? Since 
<BR>
the connection has been idle, any round trip time estimate is likely to be stale. 
<BR>
I've seen a large percentage of TCP retries on private networks with a TCP 
<BR>
application that each send short, infrequent exchanges of data. I have a hunch part 
<BR>
of the problem is this stale RTT estimate.
