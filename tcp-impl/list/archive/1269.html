<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; like have an initial idle time of five minutes, and if the peer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; responds to that keepalive, goose the idle time up to two hours or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; so for all future keepalives - the idea being that basically all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; connections are either very transient (for which even five minutes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is perhaps a bit long) or reasonably long-lived (the sort of thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for which the two-hour default was designed).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But isn't such exponential backing off still in NetBSD, derived from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1986's 4.3BSD?
</EM><BR>
<P>Exponential backoff?  No, not at all.  Using the defaults (which as I
<BR>
read tcp_timer.h are 2 hours idle, 8 probes, with 75 seconds between
<BR>
probes), if the last packet on the connection was at 10:00:00 and the
<BR>
peer goes away, keepalive probes will take place at 12:00:00, 12:01:15,
<BR>
12:02:30, 12:03:45, 12:05:00, 12:06:15, 12:07:30, and 12:08:45; if
<BR>
nothing is still received at 12:10:00, the connection will be
<BR>
considered broken.  (I may be off-by-one; that might describe a KEEPCNT
<BR>
of 9, rather than 8.)
<BR>
<P>Are you thinking of transmission backoff when there *is* data to send,
<BR>
perhaps?  Remember, these are keepalive timers, not retransmission
<BR>
timers or zero-window persist timers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or do you mean to do a steeper ramp than the 4.*BSD backoff from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initial probe interval?
</EM><BR>
<P>What I meant was not a ramp at all, but a step.  Something like sending
<BR>
keepalive probes per the above algorithm with an initial idle time of
<BR>
something like 5 minutes.  If peer doesn't respond, of course,
<BR>
connection is broken.  If peer does respond, the connection is marked
<BR>
such that in the future, the connection has to idle two hours (or
<BR>
whatever) before provoking keepalives.
<BR>
<P>Thus, in the absence of other traffic and in the absence of lost
<BR>
packets, you'd see something like
<BR>
<P>10:00:00.000 Connection goes idle
<BR>
10:05:00.000 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
10:05:00.125 ACK received
<BR>
12:05:00.125 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
12:05:00.250 ACK received
<BR>
14:05:00.250 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
14:05:00.375 ACK received
<BR>
<P>Or maybe with some real traffic thrown in,
<BR>
<P>10:00:00.000 Connection goes idle
<BR>
10:05:00.000 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
10:05:00.125 ACK received
<BR>
12:05:00.125 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
12:05:00.250 ACK received
<BR>
13:27:08.440 Real traffic begins
<BR>
13:28:44.106 Real traffic stops, connection goes idle
<BR>
15:28:44.106 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
15:28:44.241 ACK received
<BR>
17:28:44.241 Keepalive probe sent
<BR>
17:28:44.396 ACK received
<BR>
<P>I'd still prefer per-connection values, though. :-)
