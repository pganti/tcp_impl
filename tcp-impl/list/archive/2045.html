<EM>&gt; From: &quot;David R. Cheriton&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:cheriton@cisco.com?Subject=Re:%20TCP%20RDMA%20option%20to%20accelerate%20NFS,%20CIFS,%20SCSI,%20etc.&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002280044.RAA02693@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">cheriton@cisco.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Clearly, data is being received from hardware and software does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get to touch it until it has been stored to some memory.  My 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumption is that the storage system memory is arranged in fixed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size pages of disk/file pages.  Without hardware RDMA to the storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level, I believe one requires an extra copy, from whatever the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware delivers to what the storage system expects.  Either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you use twice the bandwidth in the storage system memory system or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or else you have a separate memory system for the network, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have software/processor power adequate to copy between at wire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed (with all the associated support facilities for this processor.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Unless there is something wrong with this reasoning,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it seems like a cost issue of providing the above hardware resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vs. providing a NIC chip that can RDMA.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Depending on how you are counting copies, that reasoning has been wrong
<BR>
in commercial UNIX systems for more than 10 years.
<BR>
Do you use the RDMA bits before IP checksum, the TCP checksum, and the
<BR>
medium FCS or checksum have been checked?  If not, if you receive the
<BR>
entire link layer frame into some kind of temporary buffer or FIFO,
<BR>
probably in the &quot;network interface card/controller,&quot; to check the trailing
<BR>
FCS and before using the RDMA bits, then commercial UNIX systems have been
<BR>
doing as you say to save copies since the late 1980's.  As I said before,
<BR>
such systems were a part of what killed Protocol Engines Inc.
<BR>
<P>If you do use the RDMA bits in the TCP header after 50-60 bytes of
<BR>
the frame have arrived, but before the frame FCS, aren't you worried
<BR>
about bit rot in the RDMA?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My guessitimate is that the software-only approach would be easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 times more expensive here at the higher speed rates, of 10 Gbps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there is serious doubt about the merits of real hardware support,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we should try to quantify costs further at these speed ranges, IMHO.
</EM><BR>
<P>By &quot;expensive,&quot; are you talking about dollars or bits/second?
<BR>
<P>Regardless, if you look at the number of CPU cycles or gates in custom
<BR>
silicon required to support incoming page flipping in old, existing
<BR>
implementations, I bet you'll find that they are less &quot;expensive&quot; than
<BR>
any likely RDMA implementation.  Power of 2 modular arithmetic is awfully
<BR>
cheap compared to parsing and validating TCP options.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would help me to have a more careful definition of the types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacks you have in mind.  In an unsecure network with intruders,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presumably I can end up with bad data in the right buffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or right data in the wrong buffer without using RDMA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you view we have made things worse, and if so, how?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or are you objecting to us not making things better?
</EM><BR>
<P>Is it possible for a bad guy to use RDMA to put bad data into memory
<BR>
that is not a buffer?
<BR>
<P>If the RID does no more than choose from a safe list of buffers, then how
<BR>
does RDMA usefully differ from the old FDDI, ATM, and HIPPI implementations
<BR>
that put incoming page-flippable data in buffers that get into user space
<BR>
with the data having been seen on the system bus the absolute minimum
<BR>
number of times for any scheme, including RDMA, once?
<BR>
Systems I've worked on have done mbuf allocation in the network interface
<BR>
hardware, including putting page-flippable payloads into page-mbufs that
<BR>
can eventually be flipped into user space.  And of course, take care of
<BR>
the TCP or UDP checksum.
<BR>
<P>Given the recently described extensions to readv(), absolutely
<BR>
all data received by a system like that would be page-flippable,
<BR>
and without needing the silicon or CPU cycles to parse RDMA options
<BR>
or requiring the sender to send RDMA options or even know that the
<BR>
receiver is being fast.
