<P>
<EM>&gt; My worry here is that we could see a sender that does path MTU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discovery and a naive receiver that does not.  Say the MSS is four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times the PMTU.  The receiver will ACK after receiving 2 * MSS bytes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but this'll have been perhaps 8 segments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The sender will get the ACK, and increase the congestion window by MSS,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resulting in 4 new segments, plus the 8 segments acknowledged, for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total of 12 new segments.  Ouch!
</EM><BR>
<P>My assumption is that MSS means the current maximum segment size, which
<BR>
may reflect the value offered by the receiver during start up, or may
<BR>
reflect a subsequent (smaller) value discovered by PMTU discovery.  So
<BR>
the above would lead to 9 new segments, the 8 ack'd plus one more for
<BR>
slow-start.
<BR>
<P>I would hope that receivers are a bit more intelligent about deciding
<BR>
how much data to ack, e.g., every two segments of any decent size.  But
<BR>
I don't think 2001.bis should mandate this, because we don't have a
<BR>
standard algorithm to mandate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; OTOH, if the sender only increases the congestion window by the PMTU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value (rather than MSS), then its slow-start would be really slow when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coupled with the reduced number of ACKs...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, though I suspect that, in general, receivers that offer large initial
<BR>
MSS's care enough about performance to also ack fairly often in order to
<BR>
open the window quickly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ouch, that's where I'm obviously slipping up.  I'd sure like to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these standards updated a bit to take PMTU and other advances into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account, but I guess we're pretty much just trying to get folks to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original stuff right...
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, that's what 2001.bis is trying to do.  We can also consider writing
<BR>
Experimental RFCs on tweaks to 2001.bis (such as the New Reno I-D).
<BR>
<P>One of the likely agenda topics for Orlando is whether there are enough
<BR>
PMTU issues to consider doing a document on them.  Mark &amp; I think the
<BR>
WG is pretty much ready to go dormant, except for that possibility.
