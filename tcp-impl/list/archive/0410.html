<P>
- I've been thinking about this, and I now have some modifications to
<BR>
- BSD/OS to allow a hook for raw TCP sockets.  Its purpose is to be
<BR>
- able to receive all the packet destined for a particular TCP port
<BR>
- by short-circuiting tcp_input(). ...
<BR>
- 
<BR>
- 	1) Does this seem useful?  I don't want to put something
<BR>
- 	   into our system that no one wants or would use.
<BR>
<P>Yes.  Right now, with the sockets API, there is no way to write TCP
<BR>
tests without using a separate IP address, and providing IP &amp; ARP
<BR>
support underneath the tests.  Some agreed upon raw sockets interface
<BR>
that allows TCP testing, IMHO, is a *very* useful thing to come to
<BR>
agreement on.
<BR>
<P>SunOS 5.x already has such an interface.
<BR>
<P>- 	2) The TCP checksum is verified before finding the appropriate
<BR>
- 	   PCB, so packets with bad TCP checksums don't make it up
<BR>
- 	   through this interface.
<BR>
<P>This is consistent with our current stuff.  It also verifies the checksum
<BR>
and tosses bad packets before returning data to a raw TCP socket.
<BR>
<P>- 	4) The IP portion of the packet is zeroed out except for the
<BR>
- 	   fields that are part of the TCP pseudo header (part of
<BR>
- 	   verifying the checksum).
<BR>
<P>Our code returns just the TCP header, and off the cuff I'm tempted to
<BR>
propose that if you want the IP header, you should have set the IP_HDRINCL
<BR>
socket option.
<BR>
<P>- Thoughts? Comments?
<BR>
<P>We support doing a connect() as well as a bind() on such sockets.  This
<BR>
allows you to be more selective as to which packets you're interested in.
<BR>
This also would allow things like tests to run in parallel.  We've recently
<BR>
found this useful, because as we create tests for conditions which take
<BR>
TCP though its timeout conditions, we find tests needing 10 minutes to run
<BR>
not uncommon.  Being able to run those tests in parallel, IMHO, is a
<BR>
worthwhile win.
<BR>
<P>I think the semantics of TCP raw socket imply that the protocol isn't
<BR>
really &quot;happening&quot; for you, so connect, rather akin to UDP, is just
<BR>
setting the address up as a short-hand.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
