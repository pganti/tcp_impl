<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; To be perfectly precise, the server won't &quot;wait&quot;; it should send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; periodic probes. So in this case the server is still sending TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; segments.  If it really is waiting for the client to send it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; something, the server stack is broken.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think we are using confusing nomenclature here.  The server HTTPD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process waits but the server TCP/IP continues to probe, is that it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes (on both points!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, the client application has destroyed the _socket_; isn't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection still there, in FIN_WAIT_2, happily sending zero windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in response to the server probes?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think now we need to look carefully at what it means to &quot;destroy&quot; a
<BR>
socket. Destroying a socket is more than just sending a FIN or
<BR>
RST. Two cases:
<BR>
<P>1) If the client wants to close the socket gracefully, the client TCP
<BR>
sends a FIN and waits for the server's FIN. This is the normal
<BR>
FIN_WAIT_1 &gt; FIN_WAIT_2 &gt; TIME_WAIT transition. This will not hang the
<BR>
server and the client is required to hang around reading data until
<BR>
the server is done.
<BR>
<P>2) If the client wants to close the socket immediately, and it doesn't
<BR>
care to receive any more data from the peer, it might as well just
<BR>
delete the control block. Any subsequent packets from the peer would
<BR>
solicit a RST. (Actually, a new state is probably called for, since
<BR>
you want RSTs to be generated on old packets, but you want to accept
<BR>
new connection requests provided that the sequence numbers of the new
<BR>
connection are high enough -- but there are some subtleties here).
<BR>
<P>It doesn't make sense to have the client send out a reset, and yet
<BR>
still be in FIN_WAIT_2 state. If it sends a reset, the server is
<BR>
supposed to delete its end and stop sending anything else. What will
<BR>
take the client out of the FIN_WAIT_2 state (normally, it is a FIN
<BR>
from the server!)?
<BR>
<P>If the client application is no longer associated with the socket,
<BR>
then data delivered to that connection can't be delivered to an
<BR>
application. It makes no sense for the client TCP to be advertising a
<BR>
window of 0 in that case. If it is, I'd say that stack is
<BR>
broken. Furthermore, it seems to me that the client should send back a
<BR>
RST in this case --- the data can't be delivered to the application,
<BR>
which means the sending TCP needs to be notified of a delivery
<BR>
failure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would really like to see the network trace for this...
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be quite useful indeed!
<BR>
<P>Also, going back a few messages:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The half duplex close is a MAY, but if it is implemented then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the RST transmission is a SHOULD.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK. I misunderstood that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ..I'm not suggesting that half duplex close be mandatory, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when it is used, RSTs are mandatory if received data is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pending.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really don't see this as a big issue. I'd venture that in the vast
<BR>
majority of cases, at the exect time the client half-duplex closes a
<BR>
connection, there will be no received data queued by TCP (at the
<BR>
receiver), so this scenario won't happen frequently in practice. What
<BR>
is absolutely critical, however, is that any subsequent TCP packets
<BR>
that arrive for that connection cause a RST to be generated.
