<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; - The BSD sockets API does not have a really powerful interface for 
</EM><BR>
use with event driven programming. select() and poll() are available, 
<BR>
but the performance issues associated with it have been known for 
<BR>
sometime now. Winsock has some interesting APIs which seem to help 
<BR>
somewhat better than BSD sockets APIs.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Linux supports event based real time signalling (kind of vaguely akin 
</EM><BR>
to the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;VMS AST setup).  There are plenty of people who find poll/select scale 
</EM><BR>
nicely.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Under load your syscalls/task count drops which materially improves 
</EM><BR>
your
<BR>
<EM>&gt;throughput. Thus as the load goes up degradation is good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Point a big internet client simulation (not crap like specweb) at a 
</EM><BR>
threaded
<BR>
<EM>&gt;or multiprocess server like apache and then try it with thttpd. Its 
</EM><BR>
not the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;simple set of equations some people think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[Apache btw suffers, thttpd just keeps going. apache is faster for 
</EM><BR>
small loads]
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Two issues here cause select and poll to appear bad.  The first is 
<BR>
crappy OS implementations of select;  the second is programmers that 
<BR>
don't know how to properly use select in a multithreaded environment.
<BR>
<P>Alan is spot on in that if you know what you are doing, select can be 
<BR>
quite scalable, provided your OS doesn't have a brain-dead 
<BR>
implementation (and BSD and Linux have pretty good ones).  If you just 
<BR>
throw several hundred sockets into select() and sit on it with a single 
<BR>
thread, of course it will be a poor performer.
<BR>
<P>FWIW, the select() in the networking implementation currently shipping 
<BR>
in BeOS is very, very poor.  It's one of the reasons we have rewritten 
<BR>
the OS networking for the next release.
<BR>
<P>It also seems to me that programming correctly to select() and poll() 
<BR>
is far easier and more elegant than doing it asynchronously via SIGIO.  
<BR>
That opens lots of potential cans of worms.
