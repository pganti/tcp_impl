<P>
<EM>&gt; It seems like fixing the PSH (push) bit is a more direct fix, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too is not specified sufficiently right now. That bit is intended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to flush buffers out at the sender, and force received data up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the application at the receiver. Unfortunately, the API doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specify a preemptive callback or interrupt at the receiver when PSH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is received.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you read a bit much into PSH. PSH means tell the TCP
<BR>
implementations that they are no longer allowed to continue holding
<BR>
queued data (at the sender or receiver) in the hopes that by delaying,
<BR>
more will come along shortly (making subsequent transfer - sender to
<BR>
receiver, receiver to application - more efficient). I do not
<BR>
interpret that as saying the OS is required to have TCP to send an OOB
<BR>
signal telling the application &quot;data is here, read it now&quot; (the Urgent
<BR>
pointer does that, in the case that it is needed, but that is another
<BR>
story). If the application isn't ready to read data, the PSH isn't a
<BR>
factor.
<BR>
<P>My take on this discussion is that some (sending) implementation
<BR>
doesn't set the PSH bit when it should, so the reciver buffers data
<BR>
forever (expecting data or a PSH to come along later if needed). That
<BR>
is a bug in the sender TCP; the receiver is behaving correctly.
