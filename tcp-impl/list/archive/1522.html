<P>
Dave Borman wrote a long message which i am still digesting.  However, 
<BR>
Kacheong Poon quoted one part and let me answer just that:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	If a TCP has less than a full-sized packet to transmit,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       and if the last insequence packet sent was less than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	full-sized packet and has not yet been acknowledged, do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	not transmit a packet.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that if an application does a sequence of small and large 
<BR>
writes, you send more than one small packet per RTT, which i'd rather avoid.
<BR>
<P>(All of this is complicated by the fact that most stacks, including the BSD 
<BR>
stack, actually look at the size of the send() from the application rather 
<BR>
than the size of packets transmitted over the wire.  I think this is 
<BR>
reasonable in the sense that, really, applications don't have much hope of 
<BR>
knowing what MSS might be at any particular point in time.  Others earlier in 
<BR>
this thread have mentioned this, especially w.r.t. path MTU discovery).
