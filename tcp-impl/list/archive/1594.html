<P><EM>&gt;First is the problem that the flag would not be available on most

<EM>&gt;platforms for at least a few years.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's simple - check for the flag - if it exists then use it, otherwise
<BR>
drop Nagle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Second, for an application I'm hacking, I've been trying to see how I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would use a flag or the proposed change or something else.  As far as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can tell, nothing does better than simply turning off Nagle, and I bet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same applies to HTTP.  It's not that you could not use a flush bit,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but that the packet traces and everything else would be essentially the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same as with Nagle off.  So why bother writing code that only works on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those platforms with the flush bit implemented?  Why not forget the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;flush bit even when available and just turn off Nagle?
</EM><BR>
<P>I feel we are circling in this thread :) I started out answering Joe Touch
<BR>
that this is in fact a hard question (the archives don't allow me to refer
<BR>
to individually archived messages which IMHO is really bad - HTML'ized
<BR>
archivers come cheap these days and would avoid a lot of circular and
<BR>
repeated arguments).
<BR>
<P>Yes, I too do application level buffering with all the problems of figuring
<BR>
out what a good buffer size is (I ended up using 1K as a compromise). In
<BR>
most cases this mean I don't need Nagle at all.
<BR>
<P>But, from an architectural viewpoint, I think it makes a lot more sense if
<BR>
I didn't have to do that at the application layer and that I instead could
<BR>
keep the services separated. This means that I need enough control to be
<BR>
able to indicate what I want - an explicit flush is one of those hooks.
<BR>
Today, I don't have that so I have to repeat a lot of the functionality in
<BR>
a layer above and short-circuit things like Nagle in lower layers.
