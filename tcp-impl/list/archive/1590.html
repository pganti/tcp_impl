<EM>&gt; From: Henrik Frystyk Nielsen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:frystyk@w3.org?Subject=Re:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902172103.OAA10699@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">frystyk@w3.org</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html</A> also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; discusses the issue some, suggesting that Nagle made no effect on some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; pipelined transactions, while it did have an effect in others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;They're talking about turning off Nagle regardless because sometimes doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so helps a lot.  That again makes the proposed modification moot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's because we can't control it the way we would like and don't want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffer from the potential penalty. Give me the on/off flag and I am happy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to not say that Nagle should be turned off by default.
</EM><BR>
<P>(I assume you mean an explicit flush bit, and not the proposed modification
<BR>
to the Nagle algorithm itself.)
<BR>
<P>Are you sure about that?  That you would use it?
<BR>
<P>First is the problem that the flag would not be available on most
<BR>
platforms for at least a few years.
<BR>
<P>Second, for an application I'm hacking, I've been trying to see how I
<BR>
would use a flag or the proposed change or something else.  As far as I
<BR>
can tell, nothing does better than simply turning off Nagle, and I bet
<BR>
the same applies to HTTP.  It's not that you could not use a flush bit,
<BR>
but that the packet traces and everything else would be essentially the
<BR>
same as with Nagle off.  So why bother writing code that only works on
<BR>
those platforms with the flush bit implemented?  Why not forget the
<BR>
flush bit even when available and just turn off Nagle?
<BR>
<P>My application involves mostly request-response transactions resulting
<BR>
from explicit user actions.  Looking at packet traces, I see mostly of
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data --&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;-- data+Ack
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(delay)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ack --&gt; 
<BR>
<P>with occassional
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra data --&gt; or &lt;--
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(delay, and possibly Ack packet)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data --&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;-- data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ack --&gt;
<BR>
<P>The extra data is necessary, is triggered by various async. events, must
<BR>
be handled in sequence with the main stuff, and cannot be delayed more
<BR>
than ~0.3 sec without noticable (objectionable) user interface effects.
<BR>
I think agressive caching or anticipatory cache filling in something like
<BR>
HTTP would be similar.
<BR>
<P>I've mechanims to buffer the extra data in the application, and then write
<BR>
it with the next request or response in one write().  There are timers to
<BR>
flush the buffer when no request or response comes along in time.  Still,
<BR>
I've been unable to avoid turning off Nagle, because if I do emit an extra
<BR>
data write and then discover I need to send a request, I don't want the
<BR>
request to be delayed.  If I had a flush flag I could use it on main data,
<BR>
but that would result in the same packet traces as with Nagle off.
<BR>
So why bother?
<BR>
<P>For a day or two, I thought an inverse flush bit, something that says
<BR>
&quot;delay this segment&quot; would be cool.  But that's no good either.
