Hi.  Thanks for people's responses to my query of &quot;what does Nagle on send 
<BR>
mean?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Here are what i think the variants are:
<BR>
<P>1.  FreeBSD 2.2.5, for example, says that if the send is bigger than an MTU 
<BR>
but isn't too big (bigger than MCLBYTES), and there was no outstanding 
<BR>
unacknowledged data, then all the data in the send, including any residual 
<BR>
data making up only a small packet, will be transmitted.
<BR>
<P>2.  What i think most people would agree on:  If the send is bigger than an 
<BR>
MTU, then even if there is unacknowledged data, then all the data in the send 
<BR>
(no matter how large the send was, more or less), including any residual data 
<BR>
making up only a small packet, will be transmitted.
<BR>
<P>3.  (I think this is what Vernon has in mind.)  If the send is not big enough 
<BR>
and there is data in the pipe and NODELAY is not set, then don't call 
<BR>
tcp_output().  And (if i understand correctly) don't do any Nagle in 
<BR>
tcp_output().
<BR>
<P><P>OK, so forget #1 above (it doesn't meet most of our idea of &quot;Nagle on send&quot;).
<BR>
<P>(I'm going to concentrate on #2, since i have a problem with #3, since i think 
<BR>
it means that the next ACK received will cause a small packet to be generated, 
<BR>
even if the next ACK doesn't acknowledge all outstanding data, and i'm not 
<BR>
sure that is a good idea.  Also, the *intent* (and, i guess, mostly the 
<BR>
*effect*) of #3 is the same as that of #2.)
<BR>
<P>Case #2 breaks into two categories, based on what happens if the current 
<BR>
window/cwnd doesn't allow you to immediately transmit all the data from the 
<BR>
send:
<BR>
<P>2a.  If because of window issues all the data can't be transmitted, then 
<BR>
future transmissions will be constrained by things like &quot;traditional Nagle&quot;.
<BR>
<P>2b.  If because of window issues all the data can't be transmitted, then 
<BR>
future transmissions will *not* be constrained by things like &quot;traditional 
<BR>
Nagle&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>I think one would prefer 2b.  I.e., the application makes a 64KB send() into a 
<BR>
somewhat full pipe (i.e., data already transmitting), then you'd like to send 
<BR>
the final 1296 (whatever) bytes as soon as the window allows, rather than 
<BR>
waiting for all the data to drain from the pipe and the acknowledgment of the 
<BR>
final 1460 byte segment.
<BR>
<P>Thoughts?
<BR>
<P>Greg
