Hi, 
<BR>
<P>This problem is regarding use of  two write() call in succession. Let me explain the 
<BR>
problem. In one of the blocking socket implementations, I have used two write calls mainly 
<BR>
to detect the state of the TCP connection. I can expect that if the TCP connection has 
<BR>
been closed (FIN) by the http server (due to http/1.1  timeout), the use of two write calls in sequence 
<BR>
at the client side should detect if the connection was closed. As normally expected, when I 
<BR>
make the first write() call, the server would ackowledge the client with a RST since 
<BR>
the connection was  already closed. Now, when I make my second write() call, in 
<BR>
succession, the presence of RST at the client TCP should prompt the second write() 
<BR>
to fail and return with errno to ECONNRESET. I wrote a small code to check this behaviour.
<BR>
I  ran this code in linux 2.2.16 to retrive the index.html page from an intranet web server.
<BR>
In this code, I made a TCP connection to send and retrieve the index.html file normally and 
<BR>
then slept for about 20 seconds allowing the web server to timeout.  After 20 seconds, after the
<BR>
web server had timed-out and closed the connection, I again called the two writes (breaking the request)
<BR>
&nbsp;with the same GET HTTP/1.1 request in succession. 
<BR>
I have some observations:
<BR>
<P>1. The second write() call in succession  does not fail. However, if I sleep for 1 second
<BR>
in between the two writes, the second write() call fails and returns errno with ECONNRESET.
<BR>
I checked this behaviour running it in Linux2.2.16/ SunOS _5.5.1/ 5.8 and the behavior remains same.
<BR>
&nbsp;However, in Sun OS 5.7, second write() call does not fail at all even after giving this delay. (I tried to
<BR>
&nbsp;increase the delay, but without any result). In VxWorks 5.2, we could detect the error in the second 
<BR>
write call without any delay at all.
<BR>
<P>Q.1.1  Why do we need some delay for the second write() call to fail in most of the systems??
<BR>
Q.2 .1 Why do we see such inconsistencies in various TCP implementations? (maybe I am missing 
<BR>
something)...
<BR>
<P><P>2. I checked the tcpdump output of Linux 2.2.16 and I find that when I make the second write call
<BR>
and after the client has received RST from the first write , the client TCP generates it own RST to be 
<BR>
sent to the server. I do think that this is not the expected behaviour from the TCP. I checked the tcpdump
<BR>
output running the same code in SunOS 5.7 and I dont find any RST being returned from the client to 
<BR>
the server, after it itself has received the RST. This is the normal expected behavior of TCP, which 
<BR>
is somehow not evident in Linux (I have included the tcpdump file; linuxdump.txt)
<BR>
<P>Q.2.1 Is there some problems in the 2.2.16 TCP stack of Linux that prompts it to return RST for an RST 
<BR>
when the second write() call is made ??
<BR>
<P>Maybe I am missing something important or my interpretation of the problem. 
<BR>
Would really appreciate your comments.

<P>ps: appended, please find the tcpdump(linuxdump.txt) for linux and
<BR>
the sampe code (testsock2.cpp) code used in this process.
<BR>
for compilation and final executable:  g++ testsock2.cpp -o testsock -lnsl -lsocket
<BR>
for accessing the server use:  testsock  &lt;webserver&gt;  &lt;file to be retrieved&gt;
