<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:jg@pa.dec.com?Subject=Re:%20status%20of%20T/TCP&In-Reply-To=&lt;199809181525.JAA14637@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">jg@pa.dec.com</A> (Jim Gettys)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure.  The right thing to do (if HTTP did not have such verbose request
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; response headers) would be to turn off all modem compression, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; send the HTML content compressed.  Deflate compression does very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; much better than anything in modems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Modems tend to use LZW, always (I trust) with at least 10-bit and at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sometimes more.  Judging from what Paul Mackerras has told me of his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; comparisons between BSD Compress (RFC 1977) and Deflate (RFC 1979) in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; widely used `pppd`, the difference between Deflate and your typical modem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the data that is compressed should be about the difference you see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between `compress` and `gzip`, or around a 10% improvement in compression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ratio but at a ~2X cost in CPU cycles, and mostly on the side that does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not have cycles to waste, the HTTP server.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The server can cache the compressed object, and only compress it once.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Our measurements show a much greater effect of compression than 10%;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see: <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/#Compression">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/#Compression</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This are measurements over real modems.
</EM><BR>
<P>That difference is much larger than 10%, but you neglected to mention the
<BR>
brand or even variety (e.g. v.34 vs. v.32) of the modems.  Your modems
<BR>
did about 20 kbit/sec, so they could not have been v.32, but they have
<BR>
been either v.32bis or v.34.  You also omitted TCP window sizes and mention
<BR>
of the CTE-DTE speeds, both of which have large effects.  With the high
<BR>
latencies of modem links, you really want a TCP window of more than 1
<BR>
or 2 segments, despite the fact that some TCP/IP/PPP stacks for PCs
<BR>
think 2 segments is a lot.
<BR>
<P>That your modems appeared to move data at the same speed regardless of
<BR>
whether data was compressable (i.e. precompressed or not) suggests that
<BR>
v.42bis was turned off.  Please do the obvious sanity check.  If modem
<BR>
compression were as absolutely useless as your numbers say, then why would
<BR>
anyone bother?
<BR>
<P>That your compressed and uncompressed HTML differed 11K vs. 42K means that
<BR>
your HTML is over the line into embarassingly compressable territory.  (I
<BR>
could easily believe that most image-free HTML is over that line.)  Your
<BR>
test obviously, as you note, did not have involved any images, which makes
<BR>
it a less than especially interesting test.
<BR>
<P>Over the years, I've made a bunch of measurements of precompressed, random,
<BR>
ordinary, and embarrassingly compressable data (e.g. `ttcp` or `ping`
<BR>
without -P) through SLIP/modems and PPP/modems.  At my previous major UNIX
<BR>
vendor employer, I maintained the UUCP/PPP/cu/SLIP/etc modem configuration
<BR>
scripts in my spare time, along with doing PPP, and cajoled the loan of
<BR>
a pair of modems from everyone who wanted another modem supported so that
<BR>
I could tune the scripts and make some measurements.  There is no such
<BR>
thing as a &quot;standard modem&quot; as mentioned in your report.  All modems claim
<BR>
to support various standards, but their performance varies radically,
<BR>
whether you are concerned with analog issues (i.e. phone lines) or bit
<BR>
moving.  I've seen variations up to a factor of 4 just by switching modems
<BR>
at a single modem-to-modem bit rate; never mind the modems that simply do
<BR>
not work on some phone lines.  For example one ome major brand of v.32bis
<BR>
modem seemed to be unable to send at the same time it was receiving, or
<BR>
vice versa, and so its performance with ordinary data with TCP/IP/PPP/modem
<BR>
is other than impressive because of TCP ACKs.  (v.32bis is the old,
<BR>
pre-&quot;56K&quot; standard.)
<BR>
<P>You can compare for yourself the effects of modem compression by itself
<BR>
with Deflate compression by itself comparing `gzip` with `compress` on
<BR>
your HTML pages.  (You might want `compress -b10` to make LZW as poor as
<BR>
the worst v.42bis modems.)  I bet you will rarely see more than 10% and
<BR>
will never more than 25% difference between LZ78 (or is it LZ77?) used in
<BR>
gzip and Deflate compared to the LZW used in v.42bis (modems) and
<BR>
`compress`.   (This obvious test is the standard counter to modem and PPP
<BR>
box salescritters that claim that their boxes get &quot;8:1&quot; or &quot;9:1&quot; on
<BR>
&quot;typical&quot; data.)
<BR>
<P>Note that the v.42bis modem compression standard says that when a modem
<BR>
notices that the data did not compress, it should send it in the clear.
<BR>
That means that once you've paid latency that v.42 packetizing costs,
<BR>
v.42bis compression is free--well, only in good modems.  There are of junk
<BR>
modems that can move data or compress but not both, and not very well.
<BR>
<P>Lest you say that the junk modems prove your point, I've found the USR
<BR>
Couriers, among some others, to be other than junk.  The last time I bought
<BR>
one, it cost me about $250.
<BR>
<P>Never mind the effects of PPP compression.  I have clocked my favorite
<BR>
flavor of CCP at 3-digit compression ratios over real links, with data
<BR>
patterns used in `ttcp` or `ping` without -P.  (I added -P to the `ping`
<BR>
program seen in some systems precisesly to foil modem and PPP compression.)
