Hi folks...
<BR>
<P>While debugging a completely unrelated issue in the NetBSD kernel today,
<BR>
I noticed some behavior which I felt warranted some discussion here (and
<BR>
please forgive me if this horse has been beaten into mush already...)
<BR>
<P>The problem was observed between a diskless Network Computer (`client')
<BR>
and home directory server for its workgroup (`server').
<BR>
<P>The two systems are using NFSv3 (over TCP) to communicate.
<BR>
<P>So, consider the following scenario:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) client.1023 mounts server.2049.  This causes a TCP connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be established.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Power cord on client is pulled, and reinserted.  Client reboots.
<BR>
<P>Now, at this point, you have the server in ESTABLISHED state for this
<BR>
connection.  The client thinks here is no connection.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) client.1023 mounts server.2049.  This causes a TCP connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be established.
<BR>
<P>...except, the connection never completes.  Indeed, server never sends SYN,ACK
<BR>
because out-of-window SYNs are simply dropped on the floor.
<BR>
<P>At this point, client is hosed.  The only way we can be unwedged is for the
<BR>
server to send what it thinks is an in-window packet.  This can be either
<BR>
a keepalive (very infrequent) or, if we're lucky, a retransmission of data
<BR>
left un-ACK'd when the client went down (much more frequent).  This packet
<BR>
will cause the client to generate an RST, which will cause the socket on
<BR>
the server to close, which will cause the client's attempts to connect to
<BR>
complete (since it will be a &quot;fresh&quot; connection at this point).
<BR>
<P>This behavior is probably technically correct (tho, at nearly 3am, I'm too
<BR>
tired to go look it up right now).  However, the effect it produces is
<BR>
annoying at best.
<BR>
<P>While brainstorming, some colleagues and I came up with the idea that
<BR>
resending the last ACK for the current window would be a reasonable course
<BR>
of action for the server to take in this situation (i.e. when it discovers
<BR>
an out-of-window SYN for an established connection).  This would simply
<BR>
expedite the discovery of the no-longer-established connection (by forcing
<BR>
the client to send the RST sooner).
<BR>
<P>Anyhow, I'd appreciate some input on this...
<BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
