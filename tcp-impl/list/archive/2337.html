<EM>&gt; From: Andi Kleen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ak@muc.de?Subject=Re:%20Calculations%20of%20ISN%20for%20new%20TCP%20sessions&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009171646.e8HGkt420858@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">ak@muc.de</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  - in addition to (or even instead of) a static secret that you feed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   MD5, you should use something that even the host cannot know in advance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   such as a fine granularity real time clock.  It's also nice to throw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   into the pot things with at least some bits of entropy such as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   memory addresses of TSP's and buffers containing packets such as the SYN.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least on Linux hashing the addresses of packets in would not help very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much: A SYN data payload is &lt;= 64bytes, so it would always end up in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same zone of the zone allocator. For 64byte allocations there are only a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pages in that zone, which are predictable. Brute forcing the possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addresses in the zone is quite possible (only a few thousand candidates) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the brute force attack you only need the ISN of a single SYN.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand what is meant there.  &quot;Brute force&quot; here does not mean
<BR>
the same as when you are searching for a key.  The ISN attacker gets only
<BR>
a single guess for each initial sequence number attack.  If there are a
<BR>
few thousand possible addresses for the buffer containing the SYN and if
<BR>
the probability of the SYN landing in each buffer is uniform (yes, probably
<BR>
false, but the reality is probably as good), then no matter how many times
<BR>
the bad guy tries, the odds for each try are 1 in several thousand.
<BR>
<P>I did not say to use only the buffer address, but to let it contribute
<BR>
its bits of entropy to the stew.
<BR>
<P>You cannot randomize the entire 32-bits of the ISN.  The bits in the ISN
<BR>
that you can make random are only about 16, assuming you value the
<BR>
robustness of ensuring connection retries don't have overlapping windows.
<BR>
I think that in real life, that last is a vastly bigger worry than bad
<BR>
guys guessing ISN's, since you've doubtless turned off .rhosts.
<BR>
<P>Thus, no matter what you do, the odds of any single ISN attack working
<BR>
are no worse than 1 in perhaps 100,000.  Because of the birthday paradox,
<BR>
the bad guy can expect to succeed after about the square root of number
<BR>
of bits you can randomize in the ISN.  Odds of 1 in 100,000 are about the
<BR>
same as 1 in several 1000, because even with 1:100,000, the bad guy
<BR>
can expect to succed once in every 300 or 400 tries.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; On a 10 MHz Ethernet, packets (including the SYN) arrive with milliseconds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of jitter and so more entropy than you can use for the ISN, provided you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a clock that ticks microseconds or better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; iirc that was proposed but rejected because it could possible allow an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacker with a sniffer on your local ethernet to maintain a copy of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entropy pool.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Proposed but rejected&quot; by whom and with what authority over other
<BR>
competent designers?  I doubt whoever rejected it understood the natures
<BR>
of local ethernets, sniffers, clocks, local Ethernets, and pools of
<BR>
entropy.  As I said before, if you have to worry about ISN's on
<BR>
your LAN, then you're dead.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. even if you completely randomize the ISN, a local bad guy can win
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with only 32,000 tries because of the birthday paradox, and on a local
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAN, 32,000 tries is not a problem.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. local Ethernets have far worse security problems than ISN guessing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise person ignores ISN guessing on LAN's.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. the arrival time of a packet at one Ethernet station (e.g. the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sniffer) differs from the arrival time at any other station by a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult to predict amount that as much as a slot time or 64
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;microseconds.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. even if the bad guy knows the propagation delay to the target, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target's clock will jitter due to interrupt latency and even noise in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the clock (see NTP discussions) by at least a few bits at microsecond
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolutions and lots of bits at nanosecond resolutions.  (I guess with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GHz 80*86's, even PC's can hope to have nanosecond clocks.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5. then there are bridges (i.e. &quot;switches&quot;) that randomize transmission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delays in Ethernets.  100 MHz Ethernet packets have less absolute jitter
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to CSMA/CD, but more bridges to increase queuing noise.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7. the trick in any entropy pool situation, including this one and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/dev/random, is not finding a single perfect source of true randomness
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(never mind the nonsense in &quot;true randomness&quot;), but to find enough
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entropy from enough sources.  Even the arrival times of Ethernet packets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contains only 5 or 6 bits of entropy, those 5 or 6 bits are valuable.
