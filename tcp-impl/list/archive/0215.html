||These machines often had 2-4 MB of memory even in the old days but
<BR>
||needed to stuff everything into 640KB for purely stupid reasons.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||It doesn't matter why these implementations are broken, the fact
<BR>
||remains that they are broken and their performance will be poor.  If
<BR>
||this leads to the conclusion that it is not possible to implement TCP
<BR>
||in a way that TCP will not perform poorly on some hardware platform
<BR>
||with too little memory or software platform that can't allocate memory
<BR>
||for some reason, then it must simply be accepted that these
<BR>
||implementations cannot conform to the RFC and will perform poorly.
<BR>
||
<BR>
I'll do my best not to resent this and take it personally.
<BR>
<P>Can we refrain from emotionally charged words like &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;
<BR>
and try and work with each other to clarify things and improve the TCP space?
<BR>
<P>All protocol implementations have corners into which they don't want to
<BR>
go for a variety of platform specific reasons.  The mark in my
<BR>
mind, of a good protocol implementation is how said implementation goes
<BR>
into those corners and behaves under adverse circumstances in those
<BR>
corners.  My intent in exposing my dirty laundry was to share hard
<BR>
won knowledge we at FTP found in one of those corners and to seek
<BR>
advice, which I got, in how to smooth and improve our behavior
<BR>
in those corners.
<BR>
<P>Please feel free to suggest how I can improve my product, please don't
<BR>
tell me my product is broken for doing the best balancing act it
<BR>
could under the circusmstances for which it was aimed.
<BR>
<P>L.
