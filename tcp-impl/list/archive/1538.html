<P>
<EM>&gt; I think it is reasonable to have the application buffer reasonable amounts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data, but i'm not sure it is reasonable to say it must buffer 50Kbytes or
</EM><BR>
<P>I will go along with the statement that (while desirable :) it is not
<BR>
always reasonable to expect an application with a 50K response/request
<BR>
to provide that to TCP in one call. 
<BR>
<P>I will point-out thought that I regularly see (ok, ok, in benchmarking
<BR>
:) web servers handing the transport as much data as it will take in a
<BR>
&quot;send&quot; call and that being more than 50K often enough depending on the
<BR>
&quot;SO_SNDBUF&quot; setting. 
<BR>
<P>By the time we are talking about 50K request/responses are we really
<BR>
talking request/response any more, or are we back to (short)
<BR>
unidrectional streams? Another way to ask that is is there really a
<BR>
problem with applications sending across the net 50KB of data and then a
<BR>
single byte?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 100Kbytes.  It seems to me (but, i agree, there is room here to differ) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the application is passing down its response (or request) in 4096 byte
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chunks (to pick a popular size), TCP should &quot;work well&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would probably say &quot;work well enough&quot; :) I think that if data is given
<BR>
in 4096 byte chunks that well enough is (assuming a 1460 MSS) 1460,
<BR>
1460, 1176. I see that today in netperf TCP_RR tests over some
<BR>
transports, with no nagle/delayedack induced delays:

<P>I'm even happy if that was 8192 bytes in two 4096 byte sends - unless of
<BR>
course I'm talking over a link with a 9000 byte MTU...which takes us
<BR>
into other territory :) 
<BR>
<P>I guess I would be in the camp that feels that interpreting nagle send
<BR>
by send is sufficient and the way to go and that we need to make sure
<BR>
app writers understand just what they are doing when they set
<BR>
TCP_NODELAY. A &quot;mantra&quot; along the lines of &quot;provide as much of the
<BR>
logically associated data as you can to the transport at one time&quot; or
<BR>
something...
