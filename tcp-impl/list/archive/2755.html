Dear WSEAS Friends and Members,

<BR>
Spain, in June 12-16, 2002 (DEADLINE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION:
<BR>

<BR>
<P>*  2002 WSEAS Int.Conf. on SIGNAL PROCESSING, ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION
<BR>

<BR>
<P>*  2002 WSEAS Int.Conf. on MICROWAVES, ANTENNAS AND RADAR SYSTEMS  (IMARS
<BR>

<BR>
<P>*  2002 WSEAS Int.Conf. on ELECTRONICS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS (IEHS'02)
<BR>
<P>The quality of the conference will be the same as of the other WSEAS Events.
<BR>
The Proceedings, Luxurious Post-Conference Books as well as the Special
<BR>
issues of WSEAS Trans. will be edited in WSEAS Press and will be of high
<BR>
quality and high international circulation.
<BR>
<P>We remind very kindly that only in WSEAS Conferences all the accepted papers
<BR>
are simultaneously published in two different international fora :
<BR>
Proceedings + International Books
<BR>
&nbsp;or
<BR>
Proceedings + WSEAS Transactions (Journals)
<BR>
<P>CONFERENCE PLACE:
<BR>
Iberostar Andalucia Playa and Iberostar Royal Andalus: The three joint WSEAS
<BR>
International Conferences will be held in a marvelous beach place of
<BR>
Andalucia. Here, the Arabic civilization meets the European Spirit creating
<BR>
the unique andalucian style in architecture, decoration, painting, music,
<BR>
handicraft and in general in every form of fine arts. So, the unique
<BR>
historical and exquisite natural surrounding area is the ideal back-drop for
<BR>
the conference having Already attracted the interest of academic and
<BR>
industrial world. The two linked Hotels (in a walking distance) are new
<BR>
hotels in the chain of &quot;Iberostar&quot;, on the sea front of Playa de la Barrosa,
<BR>
directly on a marvellous sandy beach, next to the Novo Sancti Petri Golf
<BR>
Club, the ideal place for golf enthusiasts. The unique architecture of the
<BR>
Hotels is inspired by the andalucian traditional architecture providing all
<BR>
the modern amenities. The place is ideal for friends of History and Folklore
<BR>
Tradition and it is a real paradise for sports-lovers, and for enthusiastic
<BR>
fans of nature, of sea and of sun.
<BR>
<P>Cadiz: Enjoy the marvellous and historical town with the richest history,
<BR>
located in a wonderful place in the strait of Gibraltar and near the famous
<BR>
river Guadalkivir. The Phoenicians, the ancient mediterranean seafarers,
<BR>
founded Cadix approximately 1,100 years BC. Cadiz holds the distinction of
<BR>
being the oldest city in Europe.
<BR>
This magnificent town is surrounded by the sea on three sides and is only
<BR>
accessible by the &quot;Puerta de Tierra,&quot; a strip of land that was constructed
<BR>
in 1755 by Torcuato Cayon. Due to the rich history of Cadiz, the monuments,
<BR>
buildings and museums are full of stories and depictions of the past. The
<BR>
old central quarters is famous for its picturesque charm, and many of the
<BR>
buildings reflect the city's overseas links.
<BR>
<P>Our Best Regards and Wishes
<BR>
See you in Spain this summer
<BR>
<P>From WSEAS Staff and the Organizing Committee
