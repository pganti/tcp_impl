<P><EM>&gt; Does the existence of too many idle connections affect the kernel resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allocation ? Are a lot of resources allocated for these connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and can that be minimized ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, yes and yes, but the problem is that if you multiply even a small
<BR>
amount of resources by a small percentage by a big number of connections,
<BR>
you have a big problem.  The costs of dead connections include:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. the kernel machinery for the TCP connection itself, including
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP state, buffering, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. the kernel machinery for the application server process that is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting for a request that will never come.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. other resources used by that application server process.
<BR>
<P>Systems intended to deal with many connections (or just SYN bombing)
<BR>
tend to have special things for minimizing the cost of TCP connections 
<BR>
that are not yet in active use.  Those things are not relevant.
<BR>
<P>The kernel resources for the connection itself (#1) are trivial compared
<BR>
to the rest.  Even if you use some kind of lightweight processes, the cost
<BR>
of a thread is generally more than the cost of a TCP socket.   Few systems
<BR>
deal well with 1,000,000 server processes, or threads.  It doesn't take
<BR>
many days for a tiny minority of 100,000,000 processes/day to amount to
<BR>
1,000,000 stale server processes.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I do not see that it makes any significant difference whether
<BR>
a TCP keepalive includes application data bytes (i.e. is done by the
<BR>
application) or not (i.e. is done on behalf of the application by lower
<BR>
layers).  Regardless, a packet is going over the wire, and probably using
<BR>
similar resources.  The familiar arguments for putting any facility into
<BR>
a central service might argue for TCP keepalives, just as no one here
<BR>
suggests implementating reliable streams in appliations using UDP instead
<BR>
of using TCP.  Religious zealotry either for or against TCP keepalives is
<BR>
as silly as the old OSI-ISO counts of angels dancing in layers.  That
<BR>
current applications do not have keepalives determines what is done by
<BR>
rational people today.

<P>] I can only say, keep up the Good Fight!  No, it's OK to allow a customer
<BR>
] to configure it to 10 seconds if he wants to!  It's just that the
<BR>
] software &quot;out of the box&quot; must have a default of at least 2 hours.  If
<BR>
] a customer wants to set it smaller, presumably he will not then complain
<BR>
] to the world about a TCP reliablity problem, having caused the problem
<BR>
] himself.   Well, maybe rational behavior is too much to hope for...
<BR>
<P>Those arguments for and against are not relevant.
<BR>
<P>Who claims that 2-hour keepalives kill valid connections?  No one then or now.
<BR>
Who cares what 4.3BSD did in 1986?--no one since Reno or Tahoe.
<BR>
Who advocates 10 second or even 30 second keepalives?--no one here.
<BR>
For that matter, no one says that all TCP connections should have keepalives
<BR>
turned on &quot;out of the box,&quot; let alone have a default interval of 10 seconds?
