<P>
K. Poon,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we agree that Nagle algorithm should be applied on a per send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis, not on a per segment basis, then change the BSD code so that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will send out the remaining data.  And I think Dave has pointed out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that his BSD code does that, more or less.  Please correct me if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misunderstood that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>1.  I may well have misunderstood what Dave said.  However, if the final 
<BR>
send() of a response is for 33 bytes, say, and there is unacknowledged data 
<BR>
(from &quot;full sized&quot; send() calls), then the current Nagle would block the 33 
<BR>
bytes until all previous data has been acknowledged.  The modified Nagle would 
<BR>
send the 33 bytes immediately (modulo windows, etc.).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't understand.  We are trying to discourage people from disabling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nagle by default, right?  Do I misunderstand your sentence above?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that is what we are trying to do.  I'm sorry that my sentence was unclear.
<BR>
<P><P>By the way, there are a couple of ways that you could apply &quot;Nagle on a per 
<BR>
send basis&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The way the TCP stack on my machine works (FreeBSD 2.2.x) is that when 
<BR>
tcp_output is called, if there is no unacknowledged data, it will send *all* 
<BR>
the available data (modulo windows), even if the last segment (possibly only 
<BR>
segment) it transmits is less than a full MSS.  In *this* case, data that is 
<BR>
*not* transmitted in this call to tcp_output because of window restrictions 
<BR>
may be subject to being delayed by Nagle the next time tcp_output is called 
<BR>
(because of a returning ACK, say).
<BR>
<P>It sounds like Dave has made sure that the entire send()'s amount of data gets 
<BR>
at least this treatment (rather than on a per-call-to-tcp_output() basis as is 
<BR>
true in my stack).  But, again, it may be the case that in his, or other's, 
<BR>
stacks, the &quot;residual&quot; data not transmitted this time around may be subject to 
<BR>
being delayed by Nagle later in the connection.
<BR>
