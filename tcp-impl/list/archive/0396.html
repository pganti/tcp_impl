Well, I'm stepping into the discussion, I'll try and be careful
<BR>
where I step...
<BR>
<P>What BSD/OS does:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system, BSD/OS, sends the Window Scale and Timestamps options
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in all SYNs, unless you turn off a system-wide sysctl variable,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net.inet.tcp.do_rfc1323.  The value of the window scale option is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inferred from the receive buffer.  I am not aware of any problem
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reports against BSD/OS directly relating to this.
<BR>
<P>Some History:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to work at Cray Research, Inc., and I probably did the first
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commercial implementation of RFC 1072/1185, later to become RFC
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1323.  (I don't remember if I yanked it or not, but UNICOS may very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well still support the ECHO and ECHO-REPLY options...)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I ran into other TCP implementations that did not deal with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new TCP options.  I don't remember the details, but at least
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the broken hosts was a terminal server.  I believe that in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the broken cases, the remote host was initiating the connection.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why RFC-1323 says that if you don't receive a Window Scale
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the initial SYN, then don't put one into the SYN/ACK.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being paranoid, and having backwards compatability stressed very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strongly,  unless it has changed, UNICOS does not send the Window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale option unless the application has explicitly asked for it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;via a setsockopt() call.  Also, in the absence of information from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the application, UNICOS will also turn around a received Window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale option, contrary to what RFC-1323 says.  I feel that this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is important for applications like rcp, where by the time the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application that knows that we want to use big buffers is running,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are long past any chance of setting the window scale option
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a non-zero value.
<BR>
<P>A Key Point:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point that no one has seemed to recognize:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiating a non-zero window scale value does
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*not* mean that you have to use large buffers!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say, you can negotiate a window scale of 4, and have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your send/receive buffers set at 8K, and things will work just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine!  The only effect of negotiating a non-zero window scale
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;option is that the granularity of the minimum amount that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window can advance by goes up.  Let's see, with a window scale
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value of 4 (Windows up to 1MB), that's 2^4 = 16.  So, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advancement of the window has to be a multiple of 16 bytes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gee, that's not an issue.  (Anyone who thinks they need to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the window by less than 16 bytes needs to think long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hard about Silly Window Syndrom...)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that implementations equate TCP Window with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive Buffer Space and with Window Scale.  These are three
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate items, and there is no reason why they have to be tied
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to each other.  There are relationships between them, but they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't have to be in lock step!
<BR>
<P>Summary:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are broke hosts out there.  I know that if you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send a Window Scale in the SYN/ACK when you didn't receive it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the SYN it will cause them grief.  That's why 1323 says don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send the Window Scale if you didn't receive one.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone know of a host that people (want to) do an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active connect to, that can't handle a Window Scale in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the initial SYN packet?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the broken hosts are mostly things like terminal servers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that only initiate connections, then I don't see a problem with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always sending a Window Scale in the initial SYN.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is perfectly reasonable for the application to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be able to directly set the Window Scale value, rather than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having it just be automatically calculated as a side effect of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting a large recieve buffer, which also causes your initial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advertised window to be large.  It's the difference between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what the application wants to be able to use, vs. what it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wants to use right now.
<BR>
