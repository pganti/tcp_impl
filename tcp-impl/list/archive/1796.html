While poking into a problem we were having with an experimental
<BR>
version of TCP I stubbled across what I think is a bug in the BSD
<BR>
timestamp code.  I found the bug in NetBSD (and have reported it to
<BR>
those folks), but it seems to be present in TCP/IP Illustrated,
<BR>
Volume 2, so I assume that it might be in other systems and
<BR>
therefore other folks might be interested, as well.
<BR>
<P>One instance of the problem appears on page 976 of TCP/IP
<BR>
Illustrated, Volume 2 (although, there are probably others, but that
<BR>
is left as an exercise).  As shown, if the timestamp option is
<BR>
present in the received ACK an RTT sample is taken (and SRTT and
<BR>
RTTVAR are updated).  However, I think a check is missing.  RFC 1323
<BR>
states that if the timestamp received is zero it is invalid and
<BR>
therefore should be ignored.  There is no check in the code for a
<BR>
timestamp of zero.  So, if a zero is received the SRTT and RTTVAR
<BR>
end up getting really hosed.
<BR>
<P>(Of course, the TCP that generated the zero timestamp was in error.
<BR>
But, I believe that is a problem with the experimental kernel I have
<BR>
been playing with.).
