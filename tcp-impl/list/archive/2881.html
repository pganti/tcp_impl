Dear Sir,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;May I indulge your trust and confidence as I
<BR>
&nbsp;introduce myself as well as intimating you of this
<BR>
&nbsp;business proposal. I am Mr Abdelhadi Benzaghou the
<BR>
&nbsp;Algeria OPEC Governor (Organization of Petroleum
<BR>
&nbsp;Exporting countries).
<BR>
&nbsp;Through the sale of our allocated oil quota in OPEC,
<BR>
&nbsp;I was able to make US$42.2million, which is
<BR>
&nbsp;currently deposited in a European Security and
<BR>
&nbsp;Finance company.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Because of my status, and my position also as a
<BR>
&nbsp;civil servant, I cannot claim this fund directly as
<BR>
&nbsp;the code of conduct bureau in Algeria forbids me to
<BR>
&nbsp;acquire such amount of money, this therefore informs
<BR>
&nbsp;my decision to  ask for your assistance to claim
<BR>
&nbsp;this money on my behalf with your due commissions.
<BR>
&nbsp;On your confirmed interest, I will first require us
<BR>
&nbsp;to familiarize ourselves possibly through the
<BR>
&nbsp;telephone, after which I shall process and make
<BR>
available all the claim documents to you with which
<BR>
&nbsp;you shall travel to Europe to personally make the
<BR>
&nbsp;due claim to the fund on my behalf. The documents of
<BR>
&nbsp;fund deposit will be changed to reflect you as the
<BR>
&nbsp;new beneficiary so that you will be eligible to
<BR>
&nbsp;collect the fund on my behalf.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;On the successful completion, I shall travel to meet
<BR>
&nbsp;you for utilization of the fund. I will give you 20%
<BR>
&nbsp;of the fund for this assistance.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I am aware of the international monitoring of all
<BR>
large-scale financial movements after the September
<BR>
&nbsp;11th terrorist attack on America and to avoid any
<BR>
&nbsp;state of financial investigation I will provide a
<BR>
&nbsp;classified clearance paper from the relevant body
<BR>
&nbsp;which will exonerate the money from either drug,
<BR>
&nbsp;money laundered or terrorist related proceeds.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Kindly respond to my offer through email
<BR>
&nbsp;as I am most times on official assignments outside
<BR>
&nbsp;Algeria.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I want to assure you that there is no risk involved
<BR>
&nbsp;in this transaction owing to my exalted personality.
<BR>
&nbsp;Meanwhile, I shall expect that you provide me with
<BR>
&nbsp;your personal telephone and fax numbers on your
<BR>
&nbsp;acceptance for familiarization and further
<BR>
&nbsp;information.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Expecting your response.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Best regards,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Mr Abdelhadi Benzaghou
<BR>
