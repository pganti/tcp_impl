<P>
These are the results of simulations exploring the conditions under which
<BR>
a larger inital window size (IW) for TCP is a &quot;win&quot; and to determine
<BR>
what effects, if any, the larger IW might have on other traffic flows
<BR>
using an IW of 1. This set of simulations was inspired by discussions
<BR>
at the Munich IETF tcp-impl and tcp-sat meetings. It appeared that some
<BR>
of the questions being raised could be addressed fairly easily in an
<BR>
ns-2 simulation. It turned out that the simulation model was easy to
<BR>
construct, but debugging ns-2's tcp-full implementation took a lot more time.
<BR>
<P>For ns-2 users: some modifications were made to the base tcp class,
<BR>
mainly fixes to the timers (tcp base class modifications by Van,
<BR>
tcp-full modifications made by both Van and myself). The tcp-full code
<BR>
was modified to use an &quot;application&quot; class and three application
<BR>
client-server pairs were written: a simple file transfer (ftp), a model
<BR>
of http1.0 style web connection and a very rough model of http1.1
<BR>
style web connection. I'll see about making these modified files available
<BR>
through the &quot;contributed code&quot; link from the ns-2 web page. (so don't bother
<BR>
me in the short term unless you're a Close Personal Friend.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URLs --&gt;		&lt;--- FTP &amp; Web data
<BR>
<P>Each left hand side node (n2-n5) has four web clients attached to
<BR>
it, each of which is served by a different web server attached to
<BR>
one of the nodes on the right hand side (n6-n8). The links to and from those
<BR>
nodes is at 10 Mbps. The bottleneck link is between n1 and n0. Depending
<BR>
on the simulation scenario, one or two ftp clients can also be
<BR>
attached to the left hand side nodes and ftp servers can be attached
<BR>
to the right hand side nodes. All links are bi-directional, but
<BR>
only acks, syns, fins, and URLs are flowing from left to right.
<BR>
<P>Assumptions made in the simulations were that all ftps transfered 1 MB
<BR>
files and that all web pages had exactly three embeded urls. The web clients
<BR>
are browsing quite aggressively, requesting a new page after a delay
<BR>
uniformly randomly distributed between 1 and 5 seconds. This is not meant to
<BR>
realistically model a single user's web-browsing pattern, but to create a
<BR>
reasonably heavy traffic load whose individual tcp connections
<BR>
accurately reflect real web traffic.
<BR>
<P>The maximum tcp window was set to 11 packets, maximum packet size to
<BR>
1460 bytes, and buffer sizes were set at 22 packets.
<BR>
(The ns-2 tcp's require setting window sizes and buffer sizes in number of
<BR>
packets. In tcp-full some of the internal parameters have been set to be
<BR>
byte-oriented, but external values must still be set in number of packets.)
<BR>
<P>The first set of simulation runs was done with 16 web clients and
<BR>
a number of ftp clients ranging from zero to 8. The IW was varied
<BR>
from 1 to 4, though the 4 packet case lies beyond what is currently
<BR>
recommended. The figures of merit used were the median page delay
<BR>
seen by the web clients and the median file transfer delay seen
<BR>
by the ftp clients. The simulated run time was rather large, 360 seconds,
<BR>
to sample a large number of these metrics. (The median values remained
<BR>
stable for twice that time, so it seemed adequate.)

<BR>

<BR>
<P>Even though the ftps use the same IW as the webs, the effect is
<BR>
not significant since there are only about 50 file transfers
<BR>
completed over the run time of the simulation. When a packet is
<BR>
dropped, the restart window size used is one packet. Thus it
<BR>
didn't seem necessary to compare web clients with larger IWs to
<BR>
ftps with shorter IWs. On the other hand, it is interesting to
<BR>
mix some webs with shorter windows with those using longer windows.
<BR>
This experiment doubled the number of web clients to 32. All 32 were
<BR>
simulated using the same initial window size, first IW=1, then IW=3.
<BR>
Then the clients were split into two groups of 16 each, one of which
<BR>
use IW=1 and the other used IW=3.

&nbsp;32	0.75	0.61
<BR>
&nbsp;16/16	0.80	0.60	
<BR>
<P>The first line shows the same result as the earlier data: clients
<BR>
with IW=3 significantly outperform clients with IW=1.  The second
<BR>
line shows that running a mixture of IW=3 &amp; IW=1 has a tiny
<BR>
negative effect on the IW=1 conversations and essentially no
<BR>
effect on the IW=3 conversations.
<BR>
<P>Since these simulations were all with http1.0 style web traffic, a
<BR>
natural question is to ask how results are affected by migration to
<BR>
http1.1. A rough model of this behavior was simulated by using one
<BR>
connection to send all of the information from both the primary URL
<BR>
and the three in-lines. These results:
<BR>
<P>Med Web Page Delay   | Med FTP Delays	| % web improvement
<BR>
#FTPs	IW=1	IW=3 | IW=1	IW=3	|  from IW=1 to IW=3

<BR>
&nbsp;0	0.57	0.45 | 			|	21
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;8	2.26	1.74 | 53.1	54.6	|	23
<BR>
<P>Although these web clients clearly have better delay properties, they
<BR>
seem to get about the same percentage delay improvement from going
<BR>
to the larger IW.
<BR>
<P>The indications from these results are that increasing the initial
<BR>
window size to 3 packets (or 4380 bytes) doesn't &quot;hurt&quot; and helps
<BR>
to improve the perceived performance. These simulations have suggested
<BR>
some further analyses of the traffic dynamics of the simulated network.
<BR>
It is also possible to do some further variations on the scenarios
<BR>
simulated here.
<BR>
<P>Using ns for the simulations made it possible to explore some
<BR>
other effects. ns-2 has a built-in RED function for buffer managment,
<BR>
making it a simple matter to rerun the simulations with the RED buffer
<BR>
managment on. With no FTPs there are no (or almost no) dropped packets,
<BR>
so that case will not differ from those with the drop tail queues.

<BR>
<P>There are two interesting aspects to these results. First, for the cases
<BR>
where there are enough concurrent FTPs to fill the buffers, there is a
<BR>
larger improvement gained going from drop tail to RED than with the
<BR>
increased IW, another validation of the usefulness of RED.
<BR>
The other is that the improvements from larger IWs are smaller with
<BR>
the RED scenario. Although deploying RED would have a more powerful
<BR>
impact on the delays seen by small transfers like typical web pages,
<BR>
increasing the initial window size is still useful.
<BR>
<P>Packet drop rates did increase with IW, but the change was not significant.
<BR>
For the drop-tail simulations, the drop rates on the congested link for all
<BR>
flows range from 0.6-1.0% for 4 FTPs, 1.6-1.9% for 6 FTPs, and 2.4-2.8%
<BR>
for 8 FTPs.  For the RED scenarios the ranges were 1.8-2.0% for 4 FTPs,
<BR>
2.9-3.2% for 6 FTPs, and 4.0-4.2% for 8 FTPs. Since the increased drop
<BR>
rates were accompanied by better performance, it's clear that, for
<BR>
these low rates, drop rate is clearly not an indicator of user level
<BR>
performance.
