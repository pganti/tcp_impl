<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure I agree that predicting ISN's would be sufficient to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get through typical SMTP relay criteria.
</EM><BR>
<P>All real-life SMTP servers I know base their relay permission criteria
<BR>
on IP numbers (sometimes dynamically configured, as in
<BR>
SMTP-after-POP).  In any case, there's usually an easily guessable
<BR>
range of IPs that the server would relay for (dial-up numbers of a
<BR>
given provider, /24 of the server itself for small organization, etc.).
<BR>
<P>You must mean authenticated SMTP.  We have yet to see it widely used.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I definitiely do not agree with &quot;untraceable,&quot; because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defenses that have evolved against other forged IP-source address
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Technically, it's not harder or easier to trace than a UDP packet that
<BR>
came with bogus source address (and that's hard).  The significant
<BR>
non-technical distinction is that abuse desk personnel has been
<BR>
trained to trust Received lines their mail server has written.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then there is the fact that in most of a decade of trying, not one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spammer has been found that can forge a believable Received: line,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despite the absolutely trivial effort needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I seem to be getting some spam with syntactically plausible forged
<BR>
Received lines (I cannot be sure since there's no way to figure out
<BR>
whether what seems to be a relay in South Dakota isn't actually the
<BR>
spammer's machine, cleverly putting itself into ORBS and generating
<BR>
bogus Received lines that point to Sprint dialup network).  That's not
<BR>
the point.  Spammers and other network abusers will learn only as fast
<BR>
as they need to--but not slower than that either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you're smart enough to turn off .rhosts, then let's hope you have not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made the gross blunder of using IP addresses as authenticators for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CGI scripts or the infinite number of similar stupid mistakes.
</EM><BR>
<P>IP numbers don't have to be used for authentication to be useful for
<BR>
tracking purposes.  Bogus complaints with doctored &quot;screenshots&quot; sent
<BR>
by &quot;personal firewalls&quot; nonwithstanding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Consider that the serious, real life attacks in the last year or two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that have involved forged IP source addresses.
</EM><BR>
<P>Forging source of TCP connections would be impossible if ISNs were
<BR>
unpredictable.  You're saying that forging sources of TCP traffic (or
<BR>
did you mean UDP and SYNs) was used in unspecified serious attacks.
<BR>
Evidently, prevention of such spoofing would make investigation
<BR>
easier.  At the same time, you place no value in this prevention.
<BR>
<P>Or did you mean DDoS &quot;attacks&quot;.  They're usually traced by the amount
<BR>
of traffic anyway, and this is simple enough.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No one is suggesting not using enough entropy and suitable software to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generate ISN's that cannot in practice be guessed, because it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently cheap.  On the other hand, I suspect that 50 CPU cycles is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ridiculously low for your Yarrow-160, what with its use of 3-DES and SHA.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true, 3DES would be more expensive.  I didn't mean to say that
<BR>
the exact code with Yarrow with the exact primitives chosen by
<BR>
Counterpane should be used.  You can have much cheaper ciphers than
<BR>
3DES (and they would provide adequate security for the purposes of ISN
<BR>
generation).
<BR>
<P>AES candidates have much better cycles per byte than 3DES, which is
<BR>
very slow--but most researched, and thus most trusted--block cipher
<BR>
algorithm.  One doesn't even need to use block cipher, which I gave as
<BR>
an example.  Hardware implementations of stream ciphers will be faster.
<BR>
