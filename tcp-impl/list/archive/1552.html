<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; separate send. I'm still not sure that is not an application bug for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not presenting the 4097 bytes of data in a writev() or the like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let's say a web server (httpd) is reading data from a CGI script, buffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, and passing it down to TCP to send out over an ethernet.  Buffering it in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4096 byte chunks seems reasonable.  Let's say the CGI script writes 4096 bytes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or, 5000 bytes, or ...).  Then the question is &quot;should the trailing bytes be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delayed by Nagle?&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;.  The application, in this case, is doing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adequate job of buffering (larger than the MSS), and the trailing data should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sent &quot;immediately&quot; (modulo windows stuff).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, unless 2*MSS is an integral divisor (?) of the blessed application
<BR>
buffering size, the second, small send is going to be delayed anyway, in
<BR>
either nagle case - original or updated right? (and I suspect we do not
<BR>
want to go down the rathole of having apps getsockopt(TCP_MAXSEG)?-)
<BR>
<P>send(4096)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transmit 1460
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transmit 1460
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transmit 1176  
<BR>
send(904)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wait for ack
<BR>
<P>The only thing that will force that second, small send out would be an
<BR>
explicit flush, and if there is an explicit flush, is there any real
<BR>
need to change the interpretation of nagle?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the thing to focus on and codify then is the explicit flush? I
<BR>
suspect that the explicit flush would be sufficient to reverse the trend
<BR>
of TCP_NODELAY usage. The app will always know better than TCP just what
<BR>
is and is not the end of a message no matter what naglesque heuristic we
<BR>
use, and even if apps started flushing on every send the behaviour on
<BR>
the net would be no worse than it is today with TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that by modifying the Nagle algorithm in the manner presented in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; draft, we can improve the performance for a percentage of the request/response
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interactions for many internet applications (including the biggie, http) in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way that is transparent to application developers.  I think this is a win.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not think that just the interpretation change alone will make much
<BR>
of a difference because the internal application buffering such as you
<BR>
discuss will not align nicely with 2*MSS, or the applications will make
<BR>
a pair of sub-mss sends.
<BR>
<P>Also, it sounds like we have a number of stacks out there already which
<BR>
are implementing something very close to the proposed change to Nagle,
<BR>
and we still have rampant use of TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
<P>So, we could go ahead with the codification of the change to nagle as
<BR>
being per-send/the draft, but unless explicit flush becomes reality I
<BR>
don't think there will be a significant impact on the use of
<BR>
TCP_NODELAY.
