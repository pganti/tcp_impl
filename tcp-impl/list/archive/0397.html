&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; In general, we need to examine whether it is feasible to blackball any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; implementation that can not swallow unrecognized options on SYN segments,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; Blackball implementations?  I don't know about your situation, but the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; sales and support people I deal with say the funniest things whenever I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; say something like &quot;that other vendor's system is broken junk; tell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; the customer to throw it out and get something that works.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; or do we have to provide a global switch to disable use of anything other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; than the MSS option.  If the problem is sufficiently widespread, you then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; have to ship with the global switch in the conservative position, to avoid
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; having system administrators everywhere going nuts discovering that they have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; to throw the switch.  Few, if any, will then enable use of these options.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; I do hope that we can decide that this approach is not neccessary.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; 
<BR>
<P>Sigh.  We went around on exactly this issue 10 years ago [!!] when we
<BR>
did Host Requirements.  My view, and I think the &quot;consensus&quot; of the
<BR>
Host Requirements WG, was something like the following:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, Vernon, the market place has its realities, and we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that you have to deal with it.  We expect that you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will do whatever you have to do.  But don't ask us to make the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patently wrong protocol choices just to ease your conscience.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strict conformance with the protocol spec should require
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default configuration be the long-term-desirable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one, e.g., to send options on SYN packets.  If your company
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chooses, for its own marketing reasons, to default your system
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to not sending SYN options, to accomodate broken systems, you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are breaking the rules.
<BR>
<P>Matt pointed out the dilemma; there is no other way to make progress.
