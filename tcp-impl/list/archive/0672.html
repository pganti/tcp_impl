<P>
<EM>&gt; A better estimate would take into account the 'permission to send'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would consider that a better fix to the bug, rather than 'research'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; per se.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I followed the thread right, the &quot;permission to send&quot; idea you outlined
<BR>
includes potential per-ack window fiddling, for acks that advance by more
<BR>
than a (so far unspecified) threshold.  This sounds like a potentially
<BR>
complicated fix that will need research to flesh it out.  Is that right,
<BR>
or are you referring above to a different fix?
<BR>
<P>I agree that the fundamental problem is recovering the ack clock whenever
<BR>
it's lost, which can occur due to reasons other than running idle.  But I'm
<BR>
reluctant to try to address the general problem in the 2001 update, because
<BR>
I think doing so will be significantly harder than just firming up
<BR>
slow-start-on-idle.
