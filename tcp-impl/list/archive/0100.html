<EM>&gt;my understanding of the problem in any way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, we can't change the past, so let's just forget it, move on, and fix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;TCP.
</EM><BR>
<P>While we're on the subject of vendors... isn't the best way to ensure that
<BR>
good TCP implementations are widely used to explicitly involve the vendors
<BR>
of popular OSes?
<BR>
<P>For example, if you could get (say) Microsoft and Sun involved, you'd cover
<BR>
most of the clients and many of the servers on the Internet. Yes, I know
<BR>
there are other popular boxes out there and Bill Gates is beelzebub, but
<BR>
let's face it -- Windows has a huge installed user base and lots of folks
<BR>
are using that Windows TCP/IP stack, and Sun also has a huge installed
<BR>
server base.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise, I feel that this team will do excellent work which could well be
<BR>
ignored.  After all, the remit of the group is:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Description of Working Group:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The objective of this group is to decide how to best address known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems in existing implementations of the current TCP standard(s) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practices.  The overall goal is to improve conditions in the existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Internet by enhancing the quality of current TCP/IP implementations. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is hoped that both performance and correctness issues can be resolved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by making implementors aware of the problems and their solutions.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the long term, it is felt that this will provide a reduction in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unnecessary traffic on the network, the rate of connection failures due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to protocol errors, and load on network servers due to time spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processing both unsuccessful connections and retransmitted data.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will help to ensure the stability of the global Internet.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe that the only way to effectively improve conditions in the
<BR>
existing Internet is to ensure that good implementations are in widespread
<BR>
use.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Mathew
<BR>
<P>PS: Please, no flameage about why [insert OS of choice] is better than
<BR>
Windows / Solaris / [other OS]
