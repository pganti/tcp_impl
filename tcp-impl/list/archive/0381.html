&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:jt@mentat.com?Subject=Re:%20%20Failure%20to%20send%20window%20scale%20option%20with%20shift.cnt%20==%200&In-Reply-To=&lt;9704301629.AA08808@can.isi.edu&gt;">jt@mentat.com</A> (Jerry Toporek)

&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand, maybe every system in the world can tolerate the option.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; &gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; Well, this is the key question, isn't it?  Most &quot;modern&quot; TCP innovations have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; been based on the assumption that we can add TCP options to SYN segments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; without breaking implementations that do not recognize them.  We have never
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; seen any problem with this assumption, and add the window scale option to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; every active connection request.  Has anyone had a problem with this?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; My vague recollection from many years ago is that we did have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; problems.  SGI has been shipping RFC 1323 support for a lot longer than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; most other outfits.
<BR>
<P>Vernon,
<BR>
<P>I believe jt is correct; there have been no problems with SYN options.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; I have some very clear memories of problems with systems that assumed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; window sizes cannot be larger than 32765, and I don't mean only boxes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; running flavors of UNIX.  One was a fancy 'scope/logic analyzer that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; when crazy and sent one byte every couple of minutes in what looked
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; like some kind of window probe.  Such experiences tend to make you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; conservative in what you send.
<BR>
<P>Yes, and that is exactly why large windows can only be used if BOTH
<BR>
sides indicate ability to deal with them.  Which is why a system that
<BR>
understands large windows but does not want to enlarge its own window
<BR>
should send a window option with zero.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; I changed SGI's default window size to 60K because it improved
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; performance significantly in interesting cases, but is there a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; significant harm to being conservative in sending the window shift
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; option?  Again, in how many applications does active-opener not set a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; large SO_RCVBUF but the passive opener wants to receive big windows?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; How many of those do not have the active-opener not set a large
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; SO_SNDBUF?
<BR>
<P>This is not a popularity contest.  But how about an FTP data connection?
<BR>
It has data flowing only one way, so only the receiver needs to use
<BR>
the large window size.  The sender does not want to tie up receive
<BR>
buffer space unnecessarily.  And some systems simply do not have
<BR>
enough buffering capacity to allow a large window at all.  An
<BR>
assymmetry of window sizes seems quite natural, to me.
<BR>
