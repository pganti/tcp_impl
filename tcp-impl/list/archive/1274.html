<BR>
****************************************************
<BR>
<P><P>Hello,
<BR>
<P>I am the mailer of this invitation, and just one of the 
<BR>
many people in the Easy Money, Compound Leveraging, 
<BR>
Educational Program, who is determined to help YOU 
<BR>
become financially independent!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;..... Have you ever wished that you could find a money 
<BR>
creating, mail order program that is simple enough, and 
<BR>
cheap enough to promote, that all you need to do, 
<BR>
is get in, tell a few friends about it and get Rich Quick, 
<BR>
without leaving the comfort of your own home?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Well, my friend, .................You have finally found it!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently became involved in this plan, by responding 
<BR>
to a flyer just like the one below this letter. I spent 
<BR>
only $5 out of my pocket to get started, and began receiving 
<BR>
envelopes  with money inside them, just a few days  
<BR>
after entering the program.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;... I could not believe my eyes, at first, because I 
<BR>
had not even had time to tell anyone about the program, 
<BR>
so I dug through the pile of other mail order junk on 
<BR>
my desk, and I found the information on the Life Without 
<BR>
Debt Plan, that I had received the previous week and I 
<BR>
Re-read every word trying to find a catch, because I was 
<BR>
sure there must be one! 
<BR>
Guess What,!!! The catch is there is no catch!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;... I also called the person who mailed me the plan, 
<BR>
to ask how this happened so fast! He explained the plan, 
<BR>
as best he could, but said he did not know much, except 
<BR>
that he to was receiving money in the mail almost daily, 
<BR>
yet he had only started advertising, by mailing a few 
<BR>
flyers each week.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;.. I know the plan can work for YOU too! Give it a try! 
<BR>
You have nothing to loose and everything to gain!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;...Return your completed Form Below, and $5 cash, to the 
<BR>
computer center as soon as possible, and they will mail you an 
<BR>
information 
<BR>
kit detailing the plan and how it works.  If you decide not to 
<BR>
participate, there is no further obligations.  
<BR>
<P>If you decide to participate, the first level plan is only 
<BR>
$5/week.  When you submit your first months dues, the computer 
<BR>
center will place up to five people below you from your uplines 
<BR>
mailings just to help you get going!
<BR>
<P>If you are as excited about this plan as I was, send in $30 cash 
<BR>
to start.  This would be $5 for the informational packet and $25 
<BR>
for your first months dues.  This will allow you to get started 
<BR>
on your way to being out of debt about a month faster than if you 
<BR>
only send in the $5.  But it is your choice.
<BR>
<P>..They only accept cash because they turn it around immediately 
<BR>
and send it out to the people already in the program.  They don't 
<BR>
have time to deal with cashing checks and tracking down bad ones 
<BR>
which is time consuming and costly.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;......... If you need to contact me to ask questions, 
<BR>
Email me at 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>... I will be happy to answer any question you have, 
<BR>
About this fantastic opportunity, If I can, although 
<BR>
I'm new to the program, and to tell you the truth, 
<BR>
I don't care how it works, because I know it works, 
<BR>
Even if I don't understand everything! Lord Knows, 
<BR>
What would happen, if I knew how it works!!
