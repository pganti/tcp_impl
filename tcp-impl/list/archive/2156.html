</EM><BR>
<P>A fun rant and it has lots of things we could argue about.  But there is
<BR>
one point where I think I can shed some light (rather than just rant back :-)).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If  you send packets in parallel surly it would be better to add a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sequence number  when dividing the input stream up, then use and remove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that sequence number when putting it back together, assuming you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control over how the stream is put back together.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is more much more complex than simply ordering.  Suppose we
<BR>
did this -- just put a sequence number on every packet at the link level
<BR>
when we went parallel, and then put it back together at the next hop.  (You
<BR>
can do this analysis for reordering at the end, too, just simpler this way).
<BR>
<P>OK, so consider the following situation:
<BR>
<P><P>Single link A -&gt; Splitter -&gt; 2 parallel links -&gt; Ordering Node -&gt; Single Link B
<BR>
<P>Further suppose that single link A is very fast (much much faster than the
<BR>
downstream links).  This assumption just makes the analysis more clear (you
<BR>
can have A be closer in speed).  Second, assume the rate of Link B is
<BR>
R, and the rate of the 2 parallel links is R/2 each (so R in aggregate).
<BR>
<P>Now imagine that you receive a packet stream of the form, one maximum size
<BR>
packet, called M, followed by 1 minimum size packet, called m.
<BR>
<P>Assume we put sequence numbers on each packet but that their cost is
<BR>
negligible.
<BR>
<P>Now, look at the link performance.
<BR>
<P>At the splitter, we get M, and start sending it on one of the parallel lines.
<BR>
Ignoring delay, M will take time (2M/R) to transmit.  Packet m arrives
<BR>
almost immediately after M (recall link A is fast) and gets sent on the
<BR>
second line.  Packet m takes time (2m/R).  So packet m arrives first.
<BR>
Indeed, since m is the minimum packet size and M is the max, the last
<BR>
bit of m arrives around the time the m-th bit of M arrives.
<BR>
<P>We want to put packets back in order before sending on link B.  So packet
<BR>
m has to wait and link B is left idle.  The idle time is the remaining
<BR>
time for packet M to arrive (which is roughly ((2M-m)/R)).  At that point
<BR>
we have all of M, and can send M and then m along.
<BR>
<P>It is useful to figure out how long it takes to send packet m from the time
<BR>
it enters the splitter until the time it leaves the ordering node.
<BR>
<P>If the parallel links were one single link, it would take time (M+m)/R to send
<BR>
m, because it has to wait for M to serialize and then itself.    But because
<BR>
we've gone parallel AND choose to delay m until M arrives to send in order,
<BR>
the time is (3M+m)/R.  So it takes roughly THREE times as long to get m
<BR>
from one end to the other, all because we put sequence numbers on.
<BR>
<P>The exact cost varies -- the key point here is not so much the time delay
<BR>
as the fact that the splitter has data (packet m) which is not being sent
<BR>
while it waits for packet M to arrive.  Unused bits are like unused
<BR>
hotel room nights: you can't reuse them and they increase the overhead.
<BR>
<P>That's why most people don't like simple sequence numbers for maintaining
<BR>
packet order.
