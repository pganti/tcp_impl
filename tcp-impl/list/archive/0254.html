<EM>&gt; Yes, the Mac tick is 1/60 second, about 17 ms.  50 ms should be plenty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time for a single application on a dedicated machine to turn around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps Apple lowered the limit to &quot;improve&quot; the code?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I'm pretty sure that it is at 50ms for OT 1.1.1 and 1.1.2.  I don't know
<BR>
what kind of Mac tick is at 1/60 sec.  As far as OT TCP is concerned, ticks
<BR>
are 1ms.  I know for sure that timing is accurate on PPC Macs.  I don't
<BR>
have a 68K Mac that I can easily check, but I am not aware of any timing
<BR>
problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, I didn't set out to test for delayed Ack.  I just was trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find out why my 600 user ISP (watervalley.net) went into congestive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collapse when I installed MacOS 7.6 on the POP3 mail server.  The reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the number of packets and retransmissions went through the roof.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is almost surely due to the RTT problems.  Given the excellent reports
<BR>
of improvement coming from the few sites that have received fixes...  I'm
<BR>
on real thin ice discussing customer product plans, so I can't.  I do hope
<BR>
you get something soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RFC-813 talks about making the delayed Ack timeout dynamically tunable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mine is srtt / 2 + mdev, with a min of 100 ms and max of 500 ms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doesn't anyone other than me actually implement a stack that tunes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ack timeout?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to admit that I missed this...  But I like it.  On the ride into
<BR>
work I was thinking about how the fixed deferred ACK interval screws up
<BR>
best case performance.  Sooner or later, someone is going to twist my arm
<BR>
to get me to justify the fact that we &quot;clearly violate the spec&quot; by blatantly
<BR>
not ACKing every other packet...  That will be fun...
<BR>
