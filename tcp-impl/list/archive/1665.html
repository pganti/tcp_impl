Hello,
<BR>
<P>Two weeks ago, I talked about some kind of packet spacing to send many
<BR>
packets at the beginning of slow start so that to avoid some RTTs and to
<BR>
reduce the time required to reach the available bandwidth. It is clear
<BR>
that such solution involves certain implicit bandwidth estimation.
<BR>
Another mechanism is required to estimate the bandwidth on the path and
<BR>
to set the timer accordingly. This lets us avoid the situation Neal
<BR>
mentioned, that of a slow modem and large packets. How to estimate the
<BR>
bandwidth, I think that Timestamp option provide us with the required
<BR>
information. Namely, the time elapsed between the transmission of two
<BR>
ACKs, together with the number of packets acked, can give the source an
<BR>
idea about the bottleneck bandwidth. Now, the time between the beginning
<BR>
of the connection and the obtaining of such information guarantees that
<BR>
the network is not very congested (because a certain number of packets
<BR>
has succeeded to cross it) and hence a faster increase of the window
<BR>
with separated packets is possible. We can use the same algorithm
<BR>
proposed by Hoe to estimate the bandwidth and then the slow start
<BR>
threshold. The difference is that here whence the bandwidth is
<BR>
estimated, a large window is transmitted by spacing the packets.
<BR>
<P>But here I ask, once such estimation is accomplished, why to not profit
<BR>
from it to spread any subsequent burst sent by TCP even in congestion
<BR>
avoidance. It is known that the loss and the compression of ACKs cause
<BR>
burstiness at the source. With some estimation of the bandwidth, these
<BR>
bursts can be spread out and some losses avoided (this is can beneficial
<BR>
in asymmetric paths). Do you think that some kind of bandwidth
<BR>
estimation and packets spread is feasible and form a practical solution?
<BR>
I am seeing this as a way to separate the transmission rate of the
<BR>
source from the arrival rate of ACKs (to don't rely on the ACK clock
<BR>
when it is disturbed). With asymmetric paths and reverse traffic, ACK
<BR>
stream doesn't represent what is happening on the forward path. 
<BR>
<P>I am currently studying the feasibility of such solution, any help will
<BR>
be very appreciated.
