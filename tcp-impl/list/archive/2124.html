I think it is fairly clear that currently, TCP gives abysmal
<BR>
performance in the presence of significant reordering.  (When the
<BR>
TCP receiver receives out-of-order packets, the TCP receiver sends
<BR>
duplicate acknowledgements to tell the TCP sender.  The TCP sender
<BR>
then does a Fast Retransmit, retransmitting the packet presumed to
<BR>
be lost, and cutting the congestion window at least in half.  This
<BR>
is true of Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and SACK TCP, and, I presume, of
<BR>
any TCP implementation more recent that 1988.)
<BR>
<P>I believe that the first step in making TCP more robust to reordering
<BR>
is in the D-SACK (duplicate-SACK) extension to SACK, &quot;An Extension
<BR>
to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) Option for TCP&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;<A HREF="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-sack-00.txt">http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-sack-00.txt</A>&quot;.
<BR>
This has already been approved by the IESG for Proposed Standard,
<BR>
and is on the RFC editor's to-do queue.
<BR>
<P>I have a draft paper, &quot;A Report on Some Recent Developments in TCP
<BR>
Congestion Control&quot;, that discusses how the D-SACK option could be
<BR>
used to make TCP more robust to reordering.  I am appending an
<BR>
excerpt from that paper below.  As the excerpt makes clear, there
<BR>
is a significant amount of work that would have to be done to take
<BR>
the information in the D-SACK option and come out with viable,
<BR>
tested algorithms that allow TCP to be robust to persistent
<BR>
reordering...

--------------------------------
<BR>
<P>From &quot;A Report on Some Recent Developments in TCP
<BR>
Congestion Control&quot;:
<BR>
<P>An initial step towards adding robustness in the presence of
<BR>
unnecessary Retransmit Timeouts and Fast Retransmits is to give
<BR>
the TCP sender the information to determine when an unnecessary
<BR>
Retransmit Timeout or Fast Retransmit has occurred..  This first
<BR>
step has been accomplished with the D-SACK (for duplicate-SACK)
<BR>
extension \cite{FMMPR99} that has recently been added to the SACK
<BR>
TCP option.  The D-SACK extension allows the TCP data receiver to
<BR>
use the SACK option to report the receipt of duplicate segments.
<BR>
With the use of D-SACK, the TCP sender can correctly infer the 
<BR>
segments that have been received by the data receiver, including
<BR>
duplicate segments. 
<BR>
<P>When the sender has retransmitted a packet, D-SACK does not allow
<BR>
TCP to distinguish between the receipt at the receiver of both the
<BR>
original and retransmitted packet, and the receipt of two copies  
<BR>
of the retransmitted packet, one of which was duplicated in the
<BR>
network.  If necessary, TCP's timestamp option could be used to
<BR>
distinguish between these two cases \cite{AP99,L99}.  However, in
<BR>
an environment with minimal packet replication in the network,
<BR>
D-SACK allows the TCP sender to make reasonable inferences, one
<BR>
round-trip time after a packet has been retransmitted, about whether
<BR>
the retransmission was necessary or unnecessary.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
If the TCP data sender determines, a round-trip time after
<BR>
retransmitting a packet, that the receiver received two copies of
<BR>
that segment and therefore that the packet retransmission was most
<BR>
likely unnecessary, then the sender could have the option of
<BR>
``undoing'' the halving in the congestion window.  The sender can
<BR>
``undo'' the recent halving of the congestion window by increasing
<BR>
the Slow-Start threshold ssthresh to the previous value of the old
<BR>
congestion window, effectively slow-starting until the congestion
<BR>
window has reached its old value.  In addition to restoring the
<BR>
congestion window, the TCP sender could adjust the duplicate
<BR>
acknowledgement threshold or the retransmit timeout parameters, to
<BR>
avoid the wasted bandwidth of persistent unnecessary retransmits.
<BR>
<P>The first part of this work, providing the information to the sender
<BR>
about duplicate packets received at the receiver, is done with the
<BR>
D-SACK extension.  The next step is to evaluate specific mechanisms
<BR>
for identifying an unnecessary halving of the congestion window,
<BR>
and for adjusting the duplicate acknowledgement threshold or
<BR>
retransmit timeout parameters.  Once this is done, there is no
<BR>
fundamental reason why TCP congestion control cannot perform
<BR>
effectively in an environment with persistent reordering.
