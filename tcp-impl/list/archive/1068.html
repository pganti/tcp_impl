<EM>&gt; I think there IS a difference.  The initial window burst happens

<EM>&gt; once per connection (OK, maybe more if it goes idle).  If you use an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ACK interval of 4 segments the burst will happen much more often.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not saying I think the burstiness that would be caused by an ACK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interval of 4 segments is acceptable or not, but I think it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently different from the larger initial window proposal.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm starting to generalize here - away from the specific of a
<BR>
four-segment ACK and more towards generic ACK avoidance.
<BR>
<P>I presume it would be bad if that added burstiness led to increased
<BR>
packet drops, but if no addional packet drops resulted (say in an
<BR>
intranet) there does seem to be a benefit as evidenced by the original
<BR>
poster's observed 8% gain.
<BR>
<P>If we assume that added packet drops resulted, what are the chances
<BR>
(under RED I presume) that the packet drops would be suffered by the
<BR>
non-bursty connections as opposed to ones that were not bursty. In other
<BR>
words, how likely is it that someone else feels the pain instead?
<BR>
<P>Now, I suspect that the original person's test was a long-lived
<BR>
connection like a netperf TCP_STREAM test, so the issue of initial slow
<BR>
start was moot, and the real world (tm) would not allow that to be moot.
<BR>
<P>In that case I suppose that a reciever wishing to avoid ACK's would have
<BR>
to have some smarts to know that slow-start was happening and ACK
<BR>
accordingly. If a burstiness resulted in packet losses for that
<BR>
connection, the receiver would see out of order packets, start sending
<BR>
immediate ACKs and (presumeably) start using an ACK policy sympatico
<BR>
with fast recovery/retransmit. 
<BR>
<P>Shouldn't the sender then arrive at a cwnd that was sufficient to allow
<BR>
his packets through in those bursts, and also have that sender (assuming
<BR>
it is only incrementing by one MSS per ACK regardless of the number of
<BR>
segments ACKed) be more conservative on its probing for additional cwnd?
<BR>
<P>I wonder if there is a theoretical sweet-spot somewhere for ACKs as a
<BR>
fraction of the perceived cwnd. As in an ACK for every 8% of cwnd, 25%,
<BR>
50%.
