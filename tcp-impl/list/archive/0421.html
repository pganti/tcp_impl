<P><EM>&gt;         Most of the emerging broadband access networks are asymmetric in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature, i.e., high BW in the downstream direction and low BW in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upstream direction. Examples include HFC, ADSL, Satellite, Wireless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access networks. In these systems, TCP Tahoe shows better performance as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to TCP Reno. This problem has been analyzed by Lakshman et.al.

</EM><BR>
<P>Subir,
<BR>
Have you actually observed the problems mentioned in this paper in your
<BR>
cable data systems? I took a look at that paper and there seem to me
<BR>
to be some assumptions made about the underlying MAC that would be
<BR>
a poor design. Lakshman et al state that a solution is to control 
<BR>
access to the upstream link. Com21's systems do this and it is
<BR>
certainly possibly within the MCNS spec. It seems like most of the
<BR>
buffer overflow problems could be solved with sufficiently large buffers.
<BR>
The asymmetry problem appears somewhat overblown, too, as the downstream
<BR>
bandwidth is the limiter for two-way cable modems and the telco return
<BR>
is only return limited if there's no sharing of the downstream. Admittedly,
<BR>
there are still a lot of unknowns about cable data system performance,
<BR>
but we haven't seen this sort of thing in detailed simulations or in
<BR>
packet traces on our systems. I'd be inclined to try to get the MAC
<BR>
designed right before trying to change the implementation of a protocol
<BR>
that runs on a lot more kinds of systems.
