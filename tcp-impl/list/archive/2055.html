<P><P><P>a tcp extension to allow transfer of virtual circuits
<BR>
<P><P>Status of this memo
<BR>
<P>this request for comments is being written after realizing that several
<BR>
independent problems could be solved by the method described herein,
<BR>
which works entirely at the transport layer.  I would like to see this
<BR>
proposal considered for adoption as an IETF standard, if it is deemed
<BR>
acceptable.  In particular, the physical format of the commands, beyond
<BR>
that it may make sense to encapsulate them in the data portion of
<BR>
invalid
<BR>
reset packets, is left to be determined by discussion.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Summary
<BR>
<P>the TCP virtual circuit as defined in Jon Postel's 1981 standard and
<BR>
subsequently clarified offers no facility for moving an end point of
<BR>
an established virtual circuit to a different peer.  There are
<BR>
situations
<BR>
in which this would be desirable.  This memo suggests a method of 
<BR>
implementing such a mechanism in such a way that it will co-exist
<BR>
seamlessly with nonextended TCP, and will work over any link layer that
<BR>
supports the TCP transport layer abstraction.
<BR>
<P><P><P>1: INTRODUCTION
<BR>
<P><P>Thinking about migratable sockets and load sharing, 
<BR>
I realized that there is an entire class of unimplemented interface
<BR>
problems, such as how to move a running xterm from one display
<BR>
to another, and how to implement &quot;user roaming&quot; without channeling
<BR>
all network traffic through a central forwarding agent, which
<BR>
could all be solved without making massive changes to all existing
<BR>
socket based applications, by adding a new primitive to TCP allowing
<BR>
a peer to &quot;transfer&quot; its end of a virtual circuit to another machine.
<BR>
<P>2: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSFER IMPERATIVE EVENT
<BR>
<P>This primitive would be a communication wedged into the cracks in
<BR>
current
<BR>
TCP implementation, either by claiming a &quot;reserved control bit&quot;
<BR>
or by sending information in the data space of a RST segment.
<BR>
<P>Packing information into a RST packet looks more doable at this time,
<BR>
since the RST segment has some spare data area in it, and the
<BR>
implementation
<BR>
guidleines in the standard include a variety of situations in which RST
<BR>
segments are to be dropped.
<BR>
<P>The primitives would include &quot;prepare-to-accept transfer from
<BR>
host:socket&quot;
<BR>
to which the response would be a host identifier:socket number which the
<BR>
connection could be transferred to; and &quot;transfer to host:socket&quot; which
<BR>
would cause the requested peer to send further packets in the stream
<BR>
being
<BR>
transferred to the new host.
<BR>
<P><P>Or the transfer could take place in a single step, by sending extended
<BR>
RST packets to both peers which are to synchronize and carry on the
<BR>
virtual
<BR>
circuit.
<BR>
<P><P>3: ONE EXAMPLE OF LIFE MADE EASIER BY USE OF THIS EXTENSION
<BR>
<P><P>As an example of this extension in use, imagine a situation in which you
<BR>
have an x-application running on host A, displayed on display server B,
<BR>
and you wish to move the display to display server C.
<BR>
<P><P>A:3841 &lt;-----&gt; B:6000 ESTABLISHED
<BR>
C
<BR>
<P><P>To transfer the window, B would open a connection to the X-server on C
<BR>
and
<BR>
display a placeholding window there, with similar characteristics as the
<BR>
window A is displaying on B.
<BR>
<P>A:3861 &lt;------&gt; B:6000 ESTABLISHED
<BR>
C:6000 &lt;------&gt; B:3094 ESTABLISHED
<BR>
<P><P>To this point, all has been accomplished with current TCP.  Using
<BR>
current
<BR>
standards, an extended X-server may relay the packets from A to C via B,
<BR>
however there is no way to phase B's role out.
<BR>
<P>The extension I am proposing in this message would allow B to send a
<BR>
message to A and C, so that A and C continue a data stream with each
<BR>
other,
<BR>
without B being involved any more.
<BR>
<P>B would accomplish this by sending A a transfer initation message on the
<BR>
A:3861-B:6000 channel, stating
<BR>
<P>&quot;prepare to transfer this channel to C:6000, passively.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This message could take the form of an invalid RST segment including a
<BR>
data block with enough information to carry the message.
<BR>
<P>A replies with the number of a socket on A which would be able to
<BR>
accept this new connection with C.  Usually this will be the current
<BR>
socket number, but there may be cases when a new number will need to 
<BR>
be selected.
<BR>
<P>In these rare cases, A reestablishes the connection being reset for
<BR>
transfer and initiates a transfer of the A-B circuit to a new port
<BR>
number on A which will not collide with an existing A-C virtual circuit.
<BR>
<P><P>This has the effect of A initiating a connection open, or opening a
<BR>
socket with the same number as the one connected to B, for listening.
<BR>
<P>A:3861 &lt;------&gt; B:6000 TRANSFERING
<BR>
C:6000 &lt;------&gt; B:3094 ESTABLISHED
<BR>
A:3861                 LISTEN
<BR>
<P>A can then send B another extended RST packet, indicating that
<BR>
it is ready to transfer the connection to C.
<BR>
<P>A noncompliant TCP will of course ignore an invalid reset segment.
<BR>
<P>This preliminary step having succeeded, B now sends C a message
<BR>
on the C:6000 &lt;------&gt; B:3094 channel, stating
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;transfer this connection to A:3861, actively&quot;
<BR>
<P>A and C now establish the new connection, using a slow start.
<BR>
<P>A:3861 &lt;------&gt; B:6000
<BR>
C:6000 &lt;------&gt; B:3094
<BR>
A:3861 &lt;------&gt; C:6000
<BR>
<P><P>and close their connections with B.
<BR>
<P>A:3861 &lt;------&gt; C:6000
<BR>
<P>4: NO EFFECT ON HIGHER LAYERS
<BR>
<P>There will be no indication that this has occurred, above the transport
<BR>
layer: it will be indistinguishable from a normal traffic hiccup.
<BR>
<P>On receipt of ACK of FIN packets, B's system call, if it had been
<BR>
blocking
<BR>
for completion of the transfer function, can return with a success code.
<BR>
<P>5: FAST TRANSFERRING WITH KNOWN-COMPLIANT TCP
<BR>
<P>If it is known in advance that both peers' TCPs support transferring,
<BR>
the extended RSTs could be sent to both, immediately, and then again,
<BR>
in case of a port number collission.
<BR>
<P>6. SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
<BR>
<P>To prevent connection transfer being used as a way to tunnel through
<BR>
common firewall implementations, the resulting connection must be
<BR>
nominally established as if it were new.
<BR>
<P><P>7. STATUS DISINFORMATION
<BR>
<P>For backwards compatability with applications that may rely on functions
<BR>
such as getpeername and sin_port member data, the transfer messages may
<BR>
include an option flag &quot;OPT_REMEMBER&quot; which will cause the TCP software
<BR>
to
<BR>
remember what the original host:socket was, instead of the current peer,
<BR>
after
<BR>
a transfer, for purposes of responding to status requests.
<BR>
<P><P>8. USE CASE: ROAMING
<BR>
<P>To use this extension to aid roaming, transfers would be arranged by the
<BR>
&quot;home server&quot; after connections are established, instead of the home
<BR>
server
<BR>
continuing to forward all traffic.
<BR>
<P>9. USE CASE: PROCESS MIGRATION LOAD BALANCING
<BR>
<P>In process migration based load balancing, tcp connections (with
<BR>
compliant peers)
<BR>
could be transferred at migration time and handled by the TCP on the
<BR>
host machine.
<BR>
<P><P><P>terminology:
<BR>
<P>In the above example, the &quot;B&quot; host is the &quot;transfer initiating peer.&quot;
<BR>
A and C are &quot;transfer end peers.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>On backwards compatability:
<BR>
<P>I believe that the RST loading method would be the best way to implement
<BR>
these extensions.  The TCP wishing to initiate the transfer could send
<BR>
RST
<BR>
packets to both peers, containing the full description of the current
<BR>
connection and the connection to be established, actively.  A TCP
<BR>
compliant with
<BR>
this standard will attempt a simultaneous open with the new peer instead
<BR>
of the old one, and send an acknowledgement. An old TCP will merely
<BR>
reset
<BR>
the current connection as if there had been a problem, and the transfer 
<BR>
initiating peer can return from the transferring function with an error
<BR>
code.
<BR>
<P><P>FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION:
<BR>
<P>The privelege to perform the transfer operation will need to
<BR>
be carefully delegated by the implementing operating system.
<BR>
Since circuit transfer operations may be initiated by a process
<BR>
outside the scope of the local connection name, both fully
<BR>
specified &lt;local socket, foreign socket&gt; pairs will need to appear
<BR>
in the invocation of a circuit transfer initation call, such as
<BR>
<P>Join
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Format: JOIN (
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first local address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first local port,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first foreign address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first foreign port,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second local address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second local port,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second foreign address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second foreign port
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
<BR>
<P>This call would cause the two fully specified connections
<BR>
to be validated for existence and establishment, and then
<BR>
combined as described in the example.
<BR>
<P>Transfer
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Format: TRANSFER (
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local port,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreign address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreign port,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second foreign address, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second foreign port
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
<BR>
<P>This call would be in effect similar to a http Location: directive;
<BR>
causing an extended RST to be sent, which would indicate that the
<BR>
connection would be better carried out with the TCP at the second
<BR>
link and port, which doesn't know you're coming, but which may be
<BR>
better prepared to provide the desired service.  Widely adopted
<BR>
implementation of this extension could greatly ease design of graceful
<BR>
load balancing, as after a server is operating at capacity instead
<BR>
of merely saying &quot;Sorry, full up!&quot; it could explicitly and instantly
<BR>
(no waiting for backup MX records to propagate through the DNS) refer
<BR>
the connection to another server.
