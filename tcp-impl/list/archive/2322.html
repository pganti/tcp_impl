<EM>&gt;&gt; What I meant were the specific codes that have been suggested, such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;application abort&quot;, &quot;bad precedence&quot;, &quot;bad security&quot;, &quot;low memory&quot;, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; This type of information is quite interesting for someone trying to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; damage. All he would need to do is repeat the same SYN ad nauseum, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; if he keeps getting &quot;application abort&quot;, he is well on his way to crash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; your server. Is this compromise enough?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Any response means he is succeeding.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily. Simple responses that don't tell him the failure reason
<BR>
prevents him to tailor his attack.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; Responding with &quot;bad precedence&quot; or &quot;bad security&quot; is synonymous with inviting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; him to try a few other values. This _adds_ compromise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bad precedence just means subsequent packets didn't match the precedence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bits. We already know that they can be changed, and sending two packets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with different values is sufficient to guarantee a crashed connection in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that case. This isn't particularly interesting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bad security makes no sense; TCP has no security (SSL does, so does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IPSEC, but then _THEY_ should carry that info, or not. not TCP :-) It'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be inappropriate to send a RST in response to failed SYN authentication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(to counter DOS attacks); silence is the best response there anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not disagreeing with you. Both of these are examples of bad codes. They are
<BR>
just two examples of the codes that have been suggested on this list by some
<BR>
people. I'm guessing (since I don't know the reason why they were initially
<BR>
suggested) that they were probably inspired by the text in page 67 of rfc793.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; A simple empty RST doesn't give him any of this information so he doesn't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; if you are just not listening on that port or that you rejected his attempt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No. He knows you're listening, and that you've responded. Otherwise,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'd have to have been spamming the world with RSTs.
</EM><BR>
<P>RFC 793, page 36, 'Reset Generation', item #1 seems to say otherwise.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I use the term &quot;listening&quot; meaning that there is a TCB in the LISTEN state
<BR>
for that port. Is that you what you meant?
<BR>
<P>And why would I (or anybody else for that matter) be spamming the world with RSTs?
<BR>
If I telnet to a port that nobody is listening on, or if inetd fails to spawn the
<BR>
proper daemon, I'll get an RST.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; He can't use the information of why you rejected a particular connection attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; against you because he doesn't know it. Adding a code to the RST provides this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; attacker with the information he needs to fine-tune his attack to bring your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; server down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is no new information here that is useful. So he tries again. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can do that now. The RST has to have information that CHANGES how he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attacks you; there isn't enough info (at least in my view of what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;included) to do that.
</EM><BR>
<P>It all depends on the kind of information that is included and that's where the
<BR>
issue hinges.
<BR>
<P>It has been suggested to add codes indicating &quot;application failure&quot; or &quot;bad
<BR>
security/precedence&quot;. These are clearly bad (at least to me) because they
<BR>
can tell him how to make his attack more efficient.
<BR>
<P>When the list of codes is finally compiled, it should be carefully scrutinized
<BR>
to make sure that this attacker is not given golden information.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;If you're that worried about hackers, use IPSEC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Regarding IPSEC, remember that there are many reasons to use TCP _without_ IPSEC,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; a web server is a good example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Web servers can use IPSEC for authentication. A web server wouldn't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too many RSTs in response to SYNs, because they typically answer (not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;initiate) connections. Sure, it could get RSTs in response to SYN/ACKs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but it can do that now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh? Web servers wouldn't be receiving RSTs: they would be _sending_ RSTs
<BR>
with potentially juicy information. The attacker would be receiving the RSTs,
<BR>
not sending them. That's what makes it easier for him to attack the server.
<BR>
<P>The other way around is not interesting at all.
