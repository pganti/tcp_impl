<P>
<EM>&gt; As Sally pointed out in the IETF meeting, we can easily come up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with scenarioes where NewReno and its variants work badly or too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aggressively.  But with SACK, we can do better.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I think no matter what TCP we have, we can always come up with
<BR>
scenarios where things don't work particularly well.  I have seen
<BR>
presentations on situations in which SACK based algorithms are
<BR>
suboptimal, as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As of now, there is no internet draft on how to make good use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SACK.  I think in 1 year's time, SACK should be widely deployed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So we should focus on how to make good use of SACK info, and also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how to avoid abusing it.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I am with you on the last statement.  We don't want people to
<BR>
abuse SACK information and make an inappropriately agressive TCP.
<BR>
That is why we inserted the statement on SACK in 2001.bis.  The
<BR>
paragraph essentially says that SACK algorithms must follow the
<BR>
spirit of the non-SACK congestion control algorithms (see the
<BR>
statement in the draft for a better (I hope!) description).
<BR>
<P>But, at this point I am not sure that the research into a SACK-based
<BR>
algorithm is done, or near a point where it is time to determine
<BR>
which algorithm is ``the best'' and standardize it.  So, it seems to
<BR>
me that the appropriate approach is to outline the general
<BR>
principles that should guide the development of SACK-based
<BR>
algorithms, in order to prevent such algorithms from hurting the
<BR>
network and contributing to congestion collapse.  However, it seems
<BR>
less important to try to decide which SACK-based algorithm is the
<BR>
best and standardize it (at least at this time).
<BR>
<P>But, I've been wrong before...
