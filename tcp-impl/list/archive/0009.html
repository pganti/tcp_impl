<P>
- &gt; I would ask of anybody who is planning on attending the BOF and who has a
<BR>
- &gt; specific TCP implementation problem to discuss, that they bring it up, in
<BR>
- &gt; advance, on this mailing list.
<BR>
- 
<BR>
- I agree.  In putting together the BOF we discussed the issue of identifying
<BR>
- specific flaws.  We recognize that it is crucial that TCP implementors find
<BR>
- the working group (if one is formed) useful and not hostile.  Implementors
<BR>
- understandably don't want problems blown out of proportion, particularly
<BR>
- ones that have already been fixed.  On the other hand, people inevitably
<BR>
- want to know which TCP's exhibit which sorts of behavior, as this can save
<BR>
- immense amounts of work in trying to debug networking problems.
<BR>
- 
<BR>
- I think the key distinction is between implementor &quot;bashing&quot; and implementor
<BR>
- &quot;naming&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I would like to suggest one way we might achieve this is by trying to
<BR>
identify, develop, and make available tools and/or methods which
<BR>
identify the problems.  By doing this, and not mentioning vendor names,
<BR>
the group can produce the means by which anyone may check any system
<BR>
for a given defect.  In this way, &quot;bashing&quot; is clearly avoided.  Those
<BR>
who are curious if one of their systems is broken, can take the tools
<BR>
and methodologies which come from this group and ascertain for
<BR>
themselves the truth.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
