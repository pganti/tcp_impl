<EM>&gt; Rick,

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Now, there may still be sufficient cases of reasonable applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that are not broken, but still &quot;suffer&quot; from Nagle, but I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (yet - I'm sure someone else will point some out :) what they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; _Maybe_ something to do with pipelined http requests generating sub
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; MSS responses?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If a response (could equally well be a request) sends an odd number of MSS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packets, and then wants to send one small packet, Nagle will block until all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the MSS packets have been acknowledged.  Because the response stream was an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; odd number of packets, the remote TCP will probably decide not to ACK for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100ms or so, thus preventing the response from making it through.  So, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response will take RTT+100ms (approximately) longer than it could have taken.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, this is the application where there is an argument to be made that Nagle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (especially when coupled with delayed ACKs) is slowing things down somewhat.
</EM><BR>
<P>But if that application is presenting that data in separate send calls,
<BR>
and it was indeed data that was really one unit, is that application
<BR>
broken or not? The whole issue here is for request/response applications
<BR>
right? Which means that there is all the data of the &quot;request&quot; and then
<BR>
all the data of the &quot;response.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With the proposed modification, the small packet will be allowed to follow the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MSS packets (assuming the window, congestion stuff, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess part of my hangup is considering any transport that did not
<BR>
interpret Nagle on a per&quot;send&quot; basis rather than a per segment basis as
<BR>
broken to begin with - perhaps then I'm in violent agreement with the
<BR>
spirit of the proposed change :) And with the sonofNagle, apps which are
<BR>
broken and sending logically associated data as two sub-MSS sends are
<BR>
still broken and still going to either get fixed by the app developer
<BR>
(unlikely but good) or disable Nagle (likely and bad) anyway. 
<BR>
<P>I'm guessing (common and bad :) that most apps that disable nagle today
<BR>
are like that - successive sub-mss sends of logically-associated data
<BR>
synchronously awaiting a response/request. Those apps are only going to
<BR>
be fixed with apps mods - either by getting all (the major) TCP's to
<BR>
include the explicit flush mechanism, or by getting the app to do a
<BR>
gthering write. If we are going to have to outreach to get apps modified
<BR>
anyway, might as well get all the &quot;rightness&quot; into them we can and get
<BR>
them onto gathering writes right?
