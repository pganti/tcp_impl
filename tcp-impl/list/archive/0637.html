<P>
Here's a summary of the input I received on TCP research issues at the
<BR>
meeting earlier this month of the IRTF's End-to-End Research Group.
<BR>
The role of these comments is to help delineate the line between research
<BR>
issues and implementation issues.  The answers are not definitive in
<BR>
an IETF standardization sense, but carry significant weight with me
<BR>
for discussions of which issues are in scope for tcp-impl and which
<BR>
are out of scope because they are still active research areas.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vern
<BR>
<P><P>Q: Is the initial slow-start cwnd going to be increased, and if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so, to what?
<BR>
A: Consensus in E2E that it can be increased to at least two packets,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as TCP's send two back-to-back packets all the time anyway.  It may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be increased to more, per a pending I-D by Sally Floyd and Mark Allman
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[and now Craig Partridge; more about this in the next message I send
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to tcp-impl].
<BR>
<P>Q: How can we keep the send window from expanding excessively once the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maximum throughput has been attained?
<BR>
A: Deploy RED.
<BR>
<P>Q: SACK is a done deal, right?
<BR>
A: Yes.
<BR>
<P>Q: How to compute RTO when using high-resolution timings?
<BR>
Q: How to compute RTO when timing more than one packet per RTT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e., how to adjust the constants for the exponentially weighted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moving average)?
<BR>
A: These are subtle, but Van Jacobson has worked them out.  He will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write something up and Vern Paxson will help get it turned into an RFC.
<BR>
<P>Q: How long a sending pause merits a new slow-start?
<BR>
A: One RTO.  The thinking is that an RTO is an upper bound estimate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on how long it takes to get feedback from the network.  Beyond
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this amount of time, you (1) have lost incoming acks for self-clocking,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and (2) don't reliably know anything about the network's state, so you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be conservative and hunt for available bandwidth again.
<BR>
<P>Q: What about waiting for more than two packets before ack'ing on a LAN?
<BR>
A: No.  If this really buys you performance, you should scrutinize your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP implementation to find out why it's so expensive to process an ack.
<BR>
<P>Q: Sharing cwnd across connections?
<BR>
A: A research issue.  The need for this is ameliorated with HTTP 1.1.
<BR>
<P>Q: Caching cwnd/ssthresh over time?
<BR>
A: cwnd, no.  ssthresh, perhaps, with a small time constant; but a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research issue.
<BR>
<P>Q: How to defend against SYN flooding attacks?
<BR>
A: No near-term recommendation.  Longer term: ingress filtering.
<BR>
<P>Q: What about deploying Vegas?
<BR>
Q: What about deploying Janey Hoe's changes?
<BR>
A: These unfortunately slipped between the cracks during the discussion.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that opinions were expressed, it is clear that significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elements of these are still viewed as research areas.
<BR>
<P>Q: Should below-sequence pure acks be acked (for keep-alives)?
<BR>
A: E2E consensus is that keep-alives belong at the application layer;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no advice on addressing this problem further in TCP.
<BR>
<P>Q: What about fast retransmit on fewer than 3 dups, if no more dups
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are coming?
<BR>
A: If you use SACK, then you can reliably know when data has left
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pipe.  On fewer than 3 dups, this lets you safely send new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data.  Retransmitting on fewer than 3 is risky.
<BR>
<P>Q: What about the RST issues Ian Heavens has raised?
<BR>
A: It would be nice in principle to fix these, as they reveal a flaw
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the proof of TCP's correctness.  However, in practice the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corruption scenarios appear unlikely, so it's not clear it's worth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going through the major procedural headaches necessary to fix this.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ian notes that these issues might also be profitably studied in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the context of designing a TCP successor.]
<BR>
<P>Q: What about Joe Touch / Ted Faber's scheme for shifting TIME-WAIT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the client?
<BR>
A: No, because this gives a disincentive for upgrading to HTTP 1.1.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Subsequently, Ted &amp; Joe told me that they have measurements showing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it's a win with both HTTP 1.0 and 1.1, so this issue will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no doubt be revisited.  Clearly, right now it's research.]
<BR>
<P>Q: Is it time to revisit constants like MSL and initial RTO?
<BR>
A: No.  For MSL, it might be good to document ways of reducing dependence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on it, such as by using PAWS.
<BR>
<P>Q: What about systematizing informational data sent in RSTs?
<BR>
A: This is actually an old idea, going back to the mid 1980's.  It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appears that the benefit is only marginal, so it's not clear it's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth the major procedural headaches necessary to standardize on it.
<BR>
<P>Q: How to fix the MSS*MSS/cwnd granularity problem (Rich Stevens
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noted that if cwnd &gt; MSS*MSS, then due to integer arithmetic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it'll never grow any larger)?
<BR>
A: Add 1.
