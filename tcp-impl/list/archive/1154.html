**********************************************************
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal debt is the number one problem most
<BR>
people face today. Easy credit and a must have 
<BR>
now attitude has created a serious debt problem
<BR>
for most individuals. A seven year economic 
<BR>
expansion in the USA, and personal bankruptcy
<BR>
is at an all time high. What happens when the 
<BR>
economy turns and jobs are lost? How many paychecks
<BR>
are you away from bankruptcy?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way out of the money crunch. You do 
<BR>
not have to go bankrupt and lose everything. There 
<BR>
is a program designed to help people get out of 
<BR>
debt quickly, while meeting all financial 
<BR>
obligations.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all you will be educated on the trap
<BR>
of using the easy credit that is mass marketed
<BR>
to us from almost every retail sector. Then you
<BR>
will be shown how to compound $5. weekly into
<BR>
$780. per week. Then you will move up and 
<BR>
compound $25. weekly into $3900. per week. You
<BR>
will learn how to pay off your mortgage, and credit
<BR>
cards in a fraction of the usual time.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If credit cards, auto loans, and a home mortgage
<BR>
are eating up your paycheck, there is an alternative.
<BR>
You can begin to take control today. For only $5.00
<BR>
you can get started in this great financial plan.
<BR>
If $5.00 is too much for you to spend, how badly
<BR>
do you need this information? Everyone is welcome to
<BR>
participate, because of the increased mailing cost
<BR>
international participants must send $10.00 in US funds
<BR>
for the start up and initial entry.
<BR>
<P>SEND $5.00 in US funds or $10.00 for international 
<BR>
participants.
