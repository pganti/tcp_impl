<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; segments.  Will this solve the problem we are discussing when combined with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the Nagle modification on a per-send basis?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which Nagle modification is that?  The algorithm as classically described
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess the phrase &quot;on a per-send basis&quot; is not clear enough...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assuming there is a problem here that needs to be solved, and that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem cannot be easily and cleanly solved with an explicit flush bit,
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Let's see if we can agree on what the problem the draft tries to solve.
<BR>
Greg and others can comment on this if I mistake.  I observe the following
<BR>
points so far.
<BR>
<P>1. There is a bad interaction between some applications, e.g. transaction
<BR>
type applications, and Nagle algorithm.
<BR>
<P>2. We have observed that many network applications set TCP_NODELAY flag by
<BR>
default, thus disabling Nagle algorithm, even though it may not be necessary.
<BR>
Many application programmers are not aware of the implications of setting
<BR>
TCP_NODELAY flag and do not understand Nagle algorithm.  But by setting
<BR>
TCP_NODELAY flag, they see their applications run better.
<BR>
<P>3. In many circumstances, Nagle algorithm helps reduce unnecessary network
<BR>
traffic.
<BR>
<P>4. Many TCP stacks already have some form of modified Nagle algorithm.  The
<BR>
interesting thing is that most people do not know about that.  And since
<BR>
there is no &quot;standard&quot; modified Nagle, application programmers cannot rely
<BR>
on this fact if they want their applications to run well on multiple
<BR>
platforms.  Thus having a modified Nagle algorithm does not help reduce
<BR>
the number of applications setting TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
<P>Because of 3, Greg and many others thought that we should find a way to 
<BR>
remedy 2.  And many such applications are like 1.  So Greg wrote the draft
<BR>
to solve 1 hoping 2 will go away.  Note that the draft does not intend to
<BR>
solve all bad interactions in 1.  But by getting rid of the most common set
<BR>
of bad interactions, 2 may go away.
<BR>
<P>Do we agree on the above points?  If we do, the question comes to if modifying
<BR>
Nagle algorithm helps.  And if by setting a &quot;standard&quot; modified Nagle, can
<BR>
application programmers rely on this fact and do not need to set TCP_NODELAY
<BR>
flag even if their applications run on multiple platforms, thus eliminating 4. 
<BR>
Does the proposed algorithm really get rid of the most common set of bad
<BR>
interactions?  Or do we only need to have an EPS mechanism, as described in
<BR>
the draft?
<BR>
<P>My observation is that Vernon, and maybe others, think that there is no
<BR>
problem at all.  It is just a problem of incompetent programmers and IETF
<BR>
should not do anything about it.  Rick and others think that we should
<BR>
document the modified Nagle many stacks also have, namely doing the check
<BR>
on a per-send basis.  This helps 4.  And to further reduce the problem set
<BR>
of bad interactions, we should investigate EPS.  Have I misunderstood the
<BR>
flow of discussions so far?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A document that would teach good programming sounds like a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Such documents are often called textbooks.  Some good textbooks contain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots of example code.  However, as you basically say about the old RFCs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the IETF is not in the introductory** textbook business.  The IETF is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards committee, not Addison-Wesley, John Wiley, or even The Microsoft
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
<P>You have been involved with IETF much longer than I do.  I guess I have
<BR>
misunderstood the intention of FYI notes and various other infomational
<BR>
documents IETF has published...  Is IETF really only a &quot;standards committee?&quot;
<BR>
Maybe you can tell me what those documents are for.  In your opinion, do
<BR>
many of them also fall into the category of textbooks and IETF should not
<BR>
have published them in the first place?  I guess probably.
<BR>
<P>My point is that it seems that so far no textbook has been clear on what Nagle
<BR>
algorithm is and its implication.  Maybe textbook authors do not care, or
<BR>
people designing protocol do not care to tell them about it, or ...  IMHO, a
<BR>
brief document from TCP implementors urging people not to disable the
<BR>
algorithm by default  and describing the right way to write network programs
<BR>
using TCP is another way to tackle the problem the draft tries to solve, but
<BR>
without modifying Nagle algorithm.  And it will carry more credits than from
<BR>
any textbook.
<BR>
