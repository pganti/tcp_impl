<EM>&gt;&gt; Is this much different than the 1 RTO timeout currently used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; in several implementations? And do you want to imply that DATO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is fixed (e.g. to 200ms) or should it be allowed to be a computed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; quanitity?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(As you opine later) DATO is always less than RTO, isn't it?  So, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suggesting a shorter time period than RTO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My estimation is that, on average, 1/2 the bandwidth since the last data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you sent (not received) could be used by someone else in your outgoing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;path.  And that value is reflected by the delayed Ack time, not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entire RTT.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to make intuitive sense to me, but I would want to run
<BR>
a lot of testing with this change to see what the real effects are.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; MinRTO must never be smaller than DATO, or you will fall over against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; anything that does delayed ACKs. In practice this currently means that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; you must not set MinRTO to less than 200ms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hmmm, wouldn't the DATO of the peer be actually included in the RTT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;calculation, as the Ack shows up later?  So, even when DATO of the peer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is longer, MinRTO won't be hit unless the peer was sending bidirectional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data, and then suddenly quits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I just looked and actually use MinRTO of 500 ms, but MinATO of 200 ms.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a few different issues mixed in here I think.
<BR>
First, ACKs are not always delayed, and we cannot easily tell
<BR>
which ACKs were delayed, and which were not. In fact, when data
<BR>
is streaming at full speed ACKs are never delayed, we just send immedate
<BR>
ACKs every second packet. When we stop sending the final ACK is likely
<BR>
to be delayed. This means that the computed RTT is almost always an
<BR>
underestimate of the real RTT + DATO, and we stand at risk of false
<BR>
retransmit of the final packet in any group of continously transmitted
<BR>
packets.
<BR>
<P>In the standard BSD implementation timers only have a 500ms
<BR>
granularity, and the DATO is fixed to 200ms. Also RFC1122 mandates
<BR>
that DATO never be more than 500ms. This means that the error is
<BR>
at most 1 tick of the retransmission timer, and the retransmission
<BR>
timer tends to be more than 1 tick overestimated in any case.
<BR>
(See details in Van Jacobson's original paper on this stuff).
<BR>
<P>But, if you have an implementation that uses higher accuracy timers
<BR>
we start to get into trouble since the DATO of the remote side
<BR>
cannot be determined by the sender, and the RTT calculation now
<BR>
has high enough accuracy that we will get a false retransmit
<BR>
on the last packet in a train. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; If we allow DATO to vary,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; e.g. as computed from packet interarrival times, then the issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; becomes even more cloudy. Ideally the DATO should be included in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the calculation of RTT, but it is not clear how to accomplish this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; since it is not easily determined which ACKs have been delayed and which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; have not, and also it is not necessarily the case that the DATO will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; fixed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've been using:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	uint32 dato = tcb-&gt;to.srtt / 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;			+ tcb-&gt;to.mdev;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	dato = max( dato, 500 );
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	dato = min( dato, 200 );
</EM><BR>
<P>Shouldn't the max and min be exchanged in the above?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I think we've been over this ground once before a few months back,
<BR>
but I'll say it again.
<BR>
<P>If we are going to go with a calculated DATO I favor something like:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dato = average packet interarrival time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dato = min(dato, 500)
<BR>
<P>The average packet interarrival time should be calculated in a way
<BR>
similar to the RTO, with the difference that extreme samples (say
<BR>
larger than RTO) should be thrown away. (We only want to sample
<BR>
time between packet arrivals in a continous stream. Note the time
<BR>
for pauses in sending.)
<BR>
<P>Here's my reasoning. We delay ACK's in the hope of reducing the
<BR>
total number of ACK's we send to every second packet, and in the hope
<BR>
off piggybacking the ACK on a data packet going the other way.
<BR>
However, we don't want to delay the ACK to much, since this messes up the
<BR>
RTO calculations on the remote side. In a stream of continous packets
<BR>
using the average packet interarrival time means we will normally
<BR>
never have an delayed ACK timeout event. This is the smallest
<BR>
estimator we can use that gives us this effect. The estimator
<BR>
you suggest is substantually more conservative, especially when
<BR>
the congestion window is large. This will probably peg the delayed
<BR>
ACK to 500ms in long/slow haul cases.
<BR>
<P>A fixed DATO of x ms means that the remote side must add in a bias of x ms
<BR>
to account for the DATO which it cannot measure. Generally because of
<BR>
the wide spread use of systems with a fixed 200ms DATO this means that
<BR>
RTO must never fall below 200ms, and perhaps should really be calculated
<BR>
RTO + 200ms (This is unclear to me, Vern Paxon suggested the additive
<BR>
calculation to me, and it makes sense, I'm just not sure it makes a
<BR>
real difference). If DATO varies in some relationship to RTT, then
<BR>
we need the RTO to be biased by that relationship. If we use your
<BR>
suggested DATO calculation the bias is easily calculated.
<BR>
I claim that the bais for my suggested DATO can similarly be calculated
<BR>
from the interarrival time of the ACKs, or alternatively by multiplying
<BR>
the RTO by (1+1/cwnd). In the Linux stack I take the second approach.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this whole discussion is meaningless if you aren't using
<BR>
high resolution timers for your TCP.
<BR>
<P>A few further related issues.
<BR>
<P>-   If the average packet interarrival time goes above 500ms,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then an interesting question arises: is there still a benifit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be had from delaying the ACK? It will cost us a timeout,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we will always take that hit, since the next packet will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never come before that timeout. In a one way stream it would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be better to ACK immediately, and avoid the 500ms extra bias
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being added to the RTO calculation on the remote side.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if data is going two ways, then we really would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like to wait a bit for a data packet to piggyback the ACK on.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted to we could also start measuring the average time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the system makes such a packet available, and when that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceeds 500ms, skip the delayed ACK all together.
<BR>
<P>-   The RFC's are not terribly clear on exactly how the RTO should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be used. There are two interpretations, which differ
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quite substantually in their effect:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When a packet is sent at time T, we expect a reply for that packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by time T + RTO.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When a packet is sent at time T, we expect a reply for the earliest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unacknowledge packet we have sent at time T + RTO.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BSD derived stacks take interperation (2). However, just reading the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RFC's interpetation (1) seems the most natural, and is quite simple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to implement if the outgoing data is pre-packetized. In BSD style
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations, where the packets are constructed from the send queue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the fly every time a packet is needed, interpretation (1) would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be fairly hard to implement, but (2) is a natural.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between these two interperations is 1/2RTT on a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symmetric path. In situations where the timers are accurate enough
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this to make a difference, interpretation (1) will kill fast
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmit, since a timeout will often occur before fast retransmit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can take place.
