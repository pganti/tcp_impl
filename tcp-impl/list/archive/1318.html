<BR>
<EM>&gt; I've always been a fan of T/TCP (if the problems that have been raised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be resolved).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't really see how they can. Although some people seem to have
<BR>
derided Charles' draft, I think the security issues are real. It is
<BR>
far harder to bring down a TCP based server than a T/TCP based
<BR>
one. The three way handshake is what saves a TCP based host -- you
<BR>
have to be in two-way communication to attack a host (you can't spoof
<BR>
sequence numbers provided you do something like RFC 1948
<BR>
stuff). T/TCP, for all its charms, can't stop you from being attacked
<BR>
with forged packets precisely because it will never require a three
<BR>
way handshake.
<BR>
<P>Is this such a big deal, though? I have a fast link, and rarely notice
<BR>
or care about the initial handshake issue on my web
<BR>
browsing. Certainly the DNS lookups that have to be done swamp any
<BR>
benefit I'll get from T/TCP. Is another 60 or 100ms such a big deal?
<BR>
<P>The problem with HTTP used to be the floods of tiny connections it
<BR>
induced and what they did to the network. Now that we have that
<BR>
problem licked with HTTP 1.1, the rest seems to be cosmetic, and as
<BR>
I've noted, that cosmetic issue seems almost lost in the noise of
<BR>
other things.
