ONLINE MARKETING - THE NEXT GENERATION OF ADVERTISING/MARKETING
<BR>
<P>Complete Online Marketing Solutions:
<BR>
<P>At Estroco Technologies, we provide all the tools necessary to promote your business/organization. 
<BR>
Whether your goal is: to have people come to your website, or to prospect for orders of products, we can 
<BR>
help. Note all prices are in US$ funds. We provide the following solutions:
<BR>
<P>1. Bulk Email Services
<BR>
<P>Let us send out your ad for you. It can be of any length, but must not be illegal in nature, or be of a 
<BR>
pornographic nature. The list below, is a general pricing. We can customize how many you want sent out. 
<BR>
<P>100,000 - 200
<BR>
200,000 - 345

400,000 - 875
<BR>
600,000 - 1,100
<BR>
800,000 - 1,300
<BR>
1,000,000 - 1,400
<BR>
2,000,000 - 2,200
<BR>
<P>2. WebSite Search Engine Promotion
<BR>
<P>One key factor for getting people to go to your website, is to have your site on search engines. The more 
<BR>
search engines you are listed on, the more hits from your attended audience you'll receive. When including 
<BR>
this option, we need the following criteria:
<BR>
<P>- website to be submitted
<BR>
- keywords to be used(max. 25)
<BR>
- Title of Web Site
<BR>
- 30 word description
<BR>
<P>Also, we allow multiple submissions, which will allow maximum exposure. As well, ever so often, sites will 
<BR>
bump your listing down so it is a good idea to have the same site, submitted at least once a month, to 
<BR>
guarantee to maintain your listing at the top.
<BR>
<P>Our prices:
<BR>
<P>100 engines &amp; directories - 15.00

cleaned of remove requests, flames, etc. Also, we have much more on stock.
