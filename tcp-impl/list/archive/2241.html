</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- Receiver discard connection (data received on a connection with no higher

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- Application abort (application requested RST on connection instead of

<EM>&gt; I'm sure that your reasons are well-meant and quite honest, but I have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder out loud if these codes won't be of great help to a hacker.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well heck, the very existence of the Internet is the greatest help a
<BR>
cracker has ever received. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For example, if I just get an RST and no code, it is harder for me to guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reason than if I get an RST with &quot;application abort&quot;. In the latter case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it might be easier to mount a DoS based on the knowledge obtained through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those messages. For example, in the previous example, I can guess that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application was run and that it probably consumed some resources, so if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can trigger this type of RST, I might be able to consume all the resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on that server and either make it crash or make it run very slowly.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would think that in this example, you can already guess that an
<BR>
application was run and/or resources were consumed when your connection
<BR>
was accepted in the first place.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps there are other texts from other situations that _might_ yield
<BR>
script-kiddie-useful info beyond the sending of the RST itself, but I
<BR>
cannot think of one myself at the moment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also hope that all those vendors mentioned have knobs to enable these codes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only when desired (they should default to disabled).
</EM><BR>
<P>ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_text_in_resets 0 for HP-UX 11. The default
<BR>
however, is 1.
