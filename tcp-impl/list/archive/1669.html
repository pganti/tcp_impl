<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've a question regarding your draft (draft-ietf-tcpimpl-newreno-02):
</EM><BR>
<P>The following is my understanding of NewReno and its variants.  The 2 basic
<BR>
ideas behind NewReno are stated in the draft.  They are:
<BR>
<P>1. Multiple drops of TCP segments in a window should be treated as a
<BR>
single congestion event.
<BR>
2. It is safe to infer from a partial ACK during fast retransmit phase
<BR>
that the next unack'ed segment is lost, retransmit it immediately.
<BR>
<P>Note that there is no mention of dup ack count in the above 2 ideas.  The
<BR>
count is an implementation detail about when to start the fast retransmit
<BR>
phase.
<BR>
<P>Reading from what you suggested, it seems to me that you did not agree that
<BR>
2 above is a good idea.  I infer that you think TCP should not retransmit a
<BR>
segment unless 3 dup acks of the previous segment are received.  While this
<BR>
may be a good idea, but I think it has its shortcomings.  Let's look at
<BR>
your example.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Example 1.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;[1] 2 3 4 5 6 [7] 8    ([ ] =  lost segments)
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When the partial ack arrives, dupacks is 6 and the draft says only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it shouldn't be reset.  As dupacks &gt;= 3, should segment 7 be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retransmitted immediately?
</EM><BR>
<P>Idea 2 says that it should.  
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;The next example shows that the proposed rule for updating the dupacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;counter doesn't prevent partial ACKs from generating retransmissions.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Let's consider a simpler example.  Using your notation, with cwnd = 5, the
<BR>
following segments are sent.
<BR>
<P>[1] [2] 3 4 5
<BR>
<P>If we use the implementation suggested by the draft, seg 1 is fast
<BR>
retransmitted as with the old algorithm.  If the retransmitted seg 1 is not
<BR>
lost, the partial ack of 1 will trigger the retransmission of seg 2.  Note
<BR>
that because of the small cwnd, no new segments are sent during the fast
<BR>
retransmit phase.  But with your suggestion about dup ack count, seg 2
<BR>
will not be retransmitted.  And because no new acks will come back, TCP
<BR>
has to time out.  This is what NewReno tries to avoid.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Example 3.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Consider an initial cwnd of 9, message 1 and 7 are lost, messages 2-6,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;8, and 9 are received. recover is set to 9 and ssthresh to 4. If we update
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dupacks as in example 1, upon receiving a partial ack for segment 6,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;segment 7 is not retransmitted immediately because the new value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dupacks is 2. However, the new cwnd is 6 and three new  data segments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(10, 11, 12) are sent. Lets assume segment 10 is dropped:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[1] 2 3 4 5 6 [7] 8 9 [10] 11 12 13   ([ ] = lost segments)
</EM><BR>
<P>NewReno will retrasnmit seg 7 immediately after getting a partial ack for
<BR>
seg 6 because TCP is still in fast retransmit phase.  It seems to me that
<BR>
you are mixing your suggestion with NewReno.
<BR>
<P>Let's look at what NewReno will do in your example more closely.  Note the
<BR>
differences from the description in your mail.
<BR>
<P>1. Seg 1 is fast retransmitted after getting dup acks elicited by segs 2, 3,
<BR>
and 4.  cwnd is set to 9/2 + 3 = 7.
<BR>
2. Dup acks elicited by segs 5, 6, 8, and 9 increases cwnd to 11.  Segs 10
<BR>
and 11 are sent.
<BR>
3. Partial ack for 6 is received, seg 7 is retransmitted.  cwnd is set to 11
<BR>
- 6 + 1 = 6.  Seg 12 can be sent.
<BR>
4. Dup ack elicited by seg 11 is received, cwnd is set to 7.  Segs 13 can be
<BR>
sent.
<BR>
5. &quot;Complete&quot; ack for seg 9 is received, cwnd is set to 4.  Fast retransmit
<BR>
phase ends.  No new seg can be sent.
<BR>
6. Dup ack elicited by segs 12, 13 are received.  Dup ack count is 2, no
<BR>
fast retransmit will happen.  TCP has to time out.
<BR>
<P>Although the end result is the same as you described, there are some subtle
<BR>
differences in the sequence of events.  And one may argue that this time out
<BR>
is a good thing.  In fast retransmit phase, the sender has already slowed
<BR>
down.  Seg 10 is sent in this phase.  If segment loss is solely because of
<BR>
congestion, the loss of seg 10 indicates that the network is congested even
<BR>
after the sending rate is dropped.  It is good for TCP to slow down further.
<BR>
This conforms to the idea that multiple drops in a window should be treated
<BR>
as one single congestion event.  Seg 10 is outside the original window.  It
<BR>
should be treated as another congestion event.  That is why dup ack count
<BR>
is reset to 0.
<BR>
<P>Note that NewReno does not try to recover all segment drops.  It just tries
<BR>
&quot;harder&quot; than the original fast retransmit algorithm.  Can your suggestion
<BR>
be added to NewReno?  May be.  But there are several things you need to
<BR>
clarify first.
<BR>
<P>1. You have to decide what a congestion event is.  You cannot keep on 
<BR>
manipulating the dup ack count.  When should this end?  Does TCP halve its
<BR>
window whenever dup ack count equals 3?
<BR>
2. I think idea 2 of NeReno is pretty safe and very helpful when drops happen
<BR>
in a burst.  Do you agree that we should not change it?  If no, why?
<BR>
<P>Basically you need to describe the reasons behind your suggestion and then
<BR>
tell us how your suggestion should be integrated into NewReno.  As mentioned
<BR>
in the draft (isn't it an RFC now?), there are many variations to NewReno.
<BR>
You are encouraged to describe yours.
