<EM>&gt; From: Art Shelest &lt;<A HREF="mailto:artshel@microsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902052334.QAA26026@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">artshel@microsoft.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This idea would effectively turn off Nagle for the most common (in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experience) bad code, which loves write-write-read-write-write-read....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It would double the number of packets on the wire for such bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; applications.  I think that would be Not Good.  Would relaxing Nagle for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2 send requests be much different from turning it off entirely?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the case above, present or draft-proposed Nagle will both generate 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packets because first will be sent immediately. The performance, however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will improve from 2 packets per 200ms to 2 packets per RTT (10+ times on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many LANs)
</EM><BR>
<P>True, Nagle does not reduce the number of packets per transaction from
<BR>
bad applications, but it reduces or at least strongly limits the number
<BR>
of packets per second from them.  As far as the rest of the network
<BR>
is concerned, the effect of Nagle is to reduce the number of packets.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I don't agree with notion that W-W-R applications come from bad programmers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application programmer should not be required a TCP expert when they simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socket as a file handle. For all they know, it may or may not be a network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If W-W-R works well with fwrite, why shouldn't it work with send?
</EM><BR>
<P>NO!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- W-W-R does NOT work well with fwrite(), compared to a single write().
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- when confronted with W-W-R, fwrite() will make as single write() 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system call, in the relevant, tiny-write cases.  That's why
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fwrite() and the rest of stdio were invented.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- mixing stdio writes and reads without any intervening fseek()s is not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the faint of heart.  Are such combinations now legal, eg. in POSIX?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- any programmer who doesn't design for the target media is incompetant.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competant programmers do what is necessary to make their code work
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well on all of their design-targeted media.  What works well on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;network streams often does not work on other media, and vice versa.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of CASE/OOP snake oil will make rewind work on a TCP stream,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does select() generally make much sense on disk files or tapes.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Large sends is a more complex case. Both Nagle(2) and modified Nagle will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extra packets with sends slightly bigger than MSS, which is bad for bulk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transfers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but good for interactive operations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  Extra packets are bad for interactive operations.  Extra packets
<BR>
cost both time and CPU cycles.  It is also true that longer delays while
<BR>
the wire is idle are worse for interactive applications.  More over, large
<BR>
transmissions are generally not involved in interactive applications, for
<BR>
obvious reasons.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; It almost sounds like Nagle needs it's own timer rather than being driven by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receiver's delayed ACK timer or RTT. This way, Nagle(T) could read:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Delay sending data until there's full MSS, but no longer than period T&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This will guarantee predictable Nagle delay, will not inhibit bulk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transfers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improve interactive performance and not depend on the receiver's delayed ACK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now we have 4 possible solutions: Nagle, modified Nagle, Nagle(N) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nagle(T)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would be interesting to compare their behavior for the cases previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described, from telnet to bulk transfer to MSS+1 sends.
</EM><BR>
<P>Adding yet another timer to TCP is an non-starter, since it fails the
<BR>
reasonable-implementation criterion.  The several timers that are now
<BR>
needed for every TCP stream are already a major burden in TCP
<BR>
implementations that care about speed, especially speed when dealing with
<BR>
lots of simultaneous streams, as on a large web server.  The gyrations
<BR>
required to make a large, fast multi-processor deal with the current
<BR>
zillions of TCP timers are painful to contemplate.
