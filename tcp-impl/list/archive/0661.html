<EM>&gt; THere is a different way to solve the problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the &quot;window allowed to send&quot; (snd_cwnd - (snd_nxt - snd_una))?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exceeds the &quot;current window size&quot; (snd_cwnd)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by more than X% (for some X), then the slow-start restart should ensue,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (can someone suggest the exact formula)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I vaguely recall a similar mechanism, during ACK processing, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't find it in the BSD code (?). When an ACK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrives that slides the window forward by more than 1/2,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the window is reset and slow-start restart ensues (does anyone recall?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given that the intent is to avoid a line-rate burst, the clearly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best mechanism is &quot;monitor and limit the window allowed-to-send size&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If you were previously in near steady state and near congestion, one
<BR>
TCP flow going idle would reduce the standing queue at the bottleneck.
<BR>
If the TCP flow that went idle was not a significant contributor to
<BR>
the bottleneck load, then the line rate burst would not be significant
<BR>
relative to other traffic.  If the TCP flow was a significant or among
<BR>
the dominant contributors than the idle period of one RTT would very
<BR>
likely allow the queue to drain.  The &lt;1 RTT idle would not result in
<BR>
a major increase in offerred load by the other TCP flows (assuming
<BR>
that most of them are not in initial slow start with no ssthresh).  If
<BR>
the single TCP flow was accounting for some portion of the bandwidth
<BR>
(1/Nth for small N) then a full window burst should be well under one
<BR>
to two delay bandwidth product for the link (the accepted minimum
<BR>
queueing requirement).
<BR>
<P>Going to slow start is a very drastic move for large window TCP.  It
<BR>
takes on the order of N RTTs to reach a window of 2^N (Jamshid argues
<BR>
that should be 1.5^N).  For a satellite link and a small transfer, that
<BR>
is a long time.
<BR>
<P>Sending large line rate bursts is bad but not terrible.
<BR>
<P>Slow starting large window TCPs is wasteful but not terrible.
<BR>
<P>There is a tradeoff and the BSD implementation currently is capable of
<BR>
sending full window bursts (idle slightly under RTO) or slow starting
<BR>
TCP (idle slightly over RTO).
<BR>
<P>It would be nice if pacing could be recovered without waiting multiple
<BR>
RTTs to do so.  Unfortunately, the only way to do that would be to
<BR>
clock out packets according to some estimate of pacing based on cwnd
<BR>
and RTO and that would involve using timers to clock out the packets.
<BR>
<P>I prefer the idea of reducing cwnd by some factor for given idle times
<BR>
so that the burst size is limited proportionally to the prior value of
<BR>
cwnd but it does not have to be limited to some small fixed integer.
<BR>
This does tend to reduce the worst case burst to 1/2 window, avoids
<BR>
slow start unless a lot of RTOs have elapsed, and reduces the burst
<BR>
and increased the tendency to go all the way back to slow start as the
<BR>
number of RTOs increase rather than have a sharp cutoff.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle = (tp-&gt;snd_max == tp-&gt;snd_una);
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (idle) {
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* outer &quot;if&quot; avoids dividing if possible */
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idleshift = 2 * tp-&gt;t_idle / tp-&gt;t_rxtcur;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (idleshift &gt; 0) {
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tp-&gt;snd_cwnd &gt;&gt;= idleshift;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (tp-&gt;snd_cwnd &lt; tp-&gt;t_maxseg)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tp-&gt;snd_cwnd = tp-&gt;t_maxseg;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<BR>
<P>I think the code above would implement the suggestion I made on
<BR>
end2end-interest early today.  If you wanted to be even more
<BR>
aggressive about limiting burst size, the 2 could be replaced with a
<BR>
large integer (4?).  Even then in cases where the variation in
<BR>
measured RTT was large compared to min RTT you might get a full window
<BR>
burst.  While far from perfect, this would be an improvement over
<BR>
current behavior short of clocking out packets on a timer.
