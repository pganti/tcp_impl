<P>
<EM>&gt; I have such an application, but it wouldn't be helped by the proposal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because its naughty writes are too small.  It still needs TCP_NODELAY.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe this is an irrelevant thread, then. Obviously there will be some
<BR>
apps that would still need to disable the modified Nagle. That does not
<BR>
mean the proposal is invalid, but probably means that the question I
<BR>
asked is irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>I suppose the question ought to be: how would the modified Nagle affect
<BR>
everyday applications? I can't really think of any situations in which
<BR>
the proposal would hurt throughput. I'd like to see some testing of
<BR>
typical apps to verify it though. Greg, do you have data showing
<BR>
different kinds of apps over extended periods that are benefitted by
<BR>
this, or that (more important) are hurt by it?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
