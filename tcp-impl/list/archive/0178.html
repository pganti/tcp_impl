<P>
||Thanks.  While I appreciate this point, I'm still wondering why in
<BR>
||limited-memory situations one would advertise a window exceeding available
<BR>
||buffer.  Why not just advertise a window equal to the buffer to ensure that
<BR>
||above-sequence data can be retained?
<BR>
||
<BR>
because these were younger and more innocent days prior to the
<BR>
Internet being on the front page of Business Week :-).  Your absolutely
<BR>
right, and it was an issue we discussed but never implemented for as you 
<BR>
say:
<BR>
<P>||A natural answer is: for added performance.  
<BR>
yes.
<BR>
||window buys you performance is for a large bandwidth-delay path.  These are
<BR>
||generally WANs, which are quite prone to packet loss, for which failing to
<BR>
||retain the above-sequence data is potentially a serious congestion
<BR>
||problem.  If the main performance concern is for a LAN, then I'd think it
<BR>
||wouldn't be hard to have enough buffer to support a sufficiently large
<BR>
||window, because due to the smaller bandwidth-delay product the window
<BR>
||doesn't actually have to be very big.  Say it's an Ethernet with a 1 msec
<BR>
||RTT.  Then:
<BR>
Aha - in simple single connection cases - FTP as an example, no
<BR>
problem - however in complex multiconnection cases - FTP to an NFS
<BR>
drive there weren't enough buffers to go around.
<BR>
<P>Again - I think the point is important to reemphasize, as its going to
<BR>
resurface again in network widgets - the stack model we had to deal
<BR>
w/ in those days was a model that supported a default of 5-10 concurrent
<BR>
connections (X ran on DOS back then..) with a buffer pool of 3-5 MTU
<BR>
sized packets and 10'ish RPC sized packets.
<BR>
<P>The more I think thru the issue the more I realize that  our receiving
<BR>
one out of sequence packet was correct, if (which we didn;t do..) we
<BR>
managed the window size more agressively as someone already suggested.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps wording to the effect that in low memory cases where out
<BR>
of sequence packet retention is limited, the window should be shrunk to
<BR>
avoid dropping incoming packets.
<BR>
<P>L.
