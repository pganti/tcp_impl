<P>
<EM>&gt; 1.It would be interesting to know how many independent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   TCP implementations exist, and the rough proportions in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   which they are represented.
</EM><BR>
<P>Also, it would be very interesting (but hard to determine!) how much
<BR>
traffic each implementation contributes.  This would let you gauge to
<BR>
what degree a widespread PC implementation actually influences Internet
<BR>
traffic.
<BR>
<P>One idea floating around is having as one of the group's products a Web
<BR>
page that would have this sort of info.  Something along the lines of
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html">http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html</A>
<BR>
<P>which Jamshid Mahdavi et al put together.  There are IETF issues regarding
<BR>
a WG providing such a page which Allison &amp; Allyn are looking into.  We
<BR>
should have something more concrete to say about this at the BOF.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. It used to be the case that there were bugs in common implementations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that you had to workaround ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   it would be enormously useful to have these listed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely!  This is one of the central goals of the WG as I see it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3.  Most of the bugs mentioned are protocol issues or end-to-end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    performance issues on a single connection.  Is it within scope to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    mention scalability issues, e.g. supporting large numbers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    connections in TIME-WAIT?
</EM><BR>
<P>This also strikes me as within scope, though with the line drawn at
<BR>
the point where things cross into the research frontier.  So, for example,
<BR>
the issues raised in Joe Touch's draft RFC are good things to discuss;
<BR>
but for some of them their resolution (e.g., how to share cwnd across
<BR>
multiple connections) is research and needs to be dealt with in another
<BR>
forum.  It seems an important benefit of the WG is to highlight where
<BR>
the research frontier is, too, so implementors can gauge where different
<BR>
features lie.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4.  Are there bugs that crop up persistently in independent TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     implementations?  e.g. mishandling of queued data for transmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     when a close is issued?  These would point to the most difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Likewise, this strikes me as a mainstream goal for the proposed WG.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5.   Should we separate buggy implementations of algorithms and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      inappropriate (or debatable) algorithms?   
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely, if by algorithm you mean what's specified in an RFC.  We need
<BR>
to consider whether some of the RFC's need clarification or expansion, but
<BR>
this is a considerably more significant step than cataloging implementation
<BR>
issues.
<BR>
