<P><EM>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, maybe every system in the world can tolerate the option.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, this is the key question, isn't it?  Most &quot;modern&quot; TCP innovations have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been based on the assumption that we can add TCP options to SYN segments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without breaking implementations that do not recognize them.  We have never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seen any problem with this assumption, and add the window scale option to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every active connection request.  Has anyone had a problem with this?
</EM><BR>
<P>My vague recollection from many years ago is that we did have
<BR>
problems.  SGI has been shipping RFC 1323 support for a lot longer than
<BR>
most other outfits.
<BR>
<P>I have some very clear memories of problems with systems that assumed
<BR>
window sizes cannot be larger than 32765, and I don't mean only boxes
<BR>
running flavors of UNIX.  One was a fancy 'scope/logic analyzer that
<BR>
when crazy and sent one byte every couple of minutes in what looked
<BR>
like some kind of window probe.  Such experiences tend to make you
<BR>
conservative in what you send.
<BR>
<P>I changed SGI's default window size to 60K because it improved
<BR>
performance significantly in interesting cases, but is there a
<BR>
significant harm to being conservative in sending the window shift
<BR>
option?  Again, in how many applications does active-opener not set a
<BR>
large SO_RCVBUF but the passive opener wants to receive big windows?
<BR>
How many of those do not have the active-opener not set a large
<BR>
SO_SNDBUF?
<BR>
