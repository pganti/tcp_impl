<P>
||&gt; Seriously we were forced into reclaiming the oldest time-wait
<BR>
||&gt; connection(s)
<BR>
||&gt; in a queue rather than continueing to allocate memory till we ate the
<BR>
||&gt; machine.
<BR>
||&gt; 
<BR>
||Yep, that's exactly why we did it in the first place. It might be less
<BR>
||of an issue now than it was then, with machines having grown larger and
<BR>
||more web clients using keep alive.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;not sure that keepalive helps the situation :-) but the more memory in a
<BR>
machine simply delays the problem but doesn't solve it.
<BR>
<P>At one point in time we happily allocated mbuf after mbuf until the machine
<BR>
ran out of memory and died.  No one complained about all the TIME-WAIT
<BR>
sessions then :-) Then we put in a max memory threshold which exposed our
<BR>
inability to create a new session which showed all the TIMe-WAIT sessions
<BR>
which caused us to copy you in reclaiming old sessions rather than waiting
<BR>
the proper 2MSL.
<BR>
<P>I also seem to recall that the issue was not uncovered with browsers; but
<BR>
instead with test scripts emulating browsers.  I know that whatever memory
<BR>
threshold we set for our memory allocation we could most definitely exhaust
<BR>
the pool with TIME-WAIT connections.  Granted we were using perhaps only
<BR>
64 Meg of memory (says the man who started when 512K was plenty for DOS..)
<BR>
but even w/ a maxed out NT server the problem could still be recreated with
<BR>
an agressive enough test suite.
<BR>
<P>L.
