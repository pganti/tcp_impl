||Not a good idea.  If you loose one, you loose them all.  Many years ago
<BR>
||I ran into a case where two Crays with a 16K MTU for their local
<BR>
||networks were separated by the ARPANET.  The sent 16K TCP packets
<BR>
||that got fragmented.  The loss rate was such that they usually lost
<BR>
||one of the fragments.  Then they'd retransmit another 16k packet,
<BR>
||which lost one of the fragments, and the connection would sit like
<BR>
||that, never succeeding in doing any useful work.
<BR>
||
<BR>
<P>hmmm.  where have I seen this before :-)  Can you say in my NFS past
<BR>
w/ 8K UDP packets and no backoff.  Which led to us, as well as everyone
<BR>
else, implementing TCP as part of their NFS.
<BR>
<P>I fondly remember one certain vendor's ethernet card which reliably
<BR>
dropped packet 4 of a 6 packet 8K UDP NFS_READ.  We had many happy
<BR>
customers the day we added &quot;autotuning&quot; to NFS which was nothing more
<BR>
than slow start with a high water cwnd applied to NFS.
<BR>
<P>And I know this is alien to the list but it seems to me that as we
<BR>
are relying on MTU discovery to solve all our problems because we
<BR>
are only dealing with TCP, good old NFS over UDP keeps chugging along,
<BR>
churning out those large atomic UDP writes.  Granted that NFS over TCP
<BR>
is somewhat standard now; but an uncontrolled NFS over UDP can make
<BR>
a mess out of a pair of LAN's interconnected by a slow WAN bridge.
<BR>
<P>L.
