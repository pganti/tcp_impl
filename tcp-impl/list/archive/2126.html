Overnight thinking on TCP and reordering.
<BR>
<P>Given the following:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the receiver knows there is reordering;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* reordering will occur in less than 1RTT;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the receiver can compute the RTT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* we already tolerate delayed ACKs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the first duplicate ACKs will not trigger any new data transmission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(maybe excet with SACK, i am a bit out-of-date on this)
<BR>
wouldn't it make sense for the receiver who sees out-of-sequence
<BR>
delivery of packets to withold the ACKs for such packets until
<BR>
a) the hole is filled, or b) a small timeout has elapsed (this can be
<BR>
of the same order of the delayed ack timer, or half the RTT if we have
<BR>
a local estimate available).
<BR>
<P>The only drawback i see is some burstiness in the flow, as the ACKs
<BR>
which would reach the sender would liberate a number of packets
<BR>
(this could be a problem as reordering might not occur at the
<BR>
bottleneck), and of course one should use byte-counting rather than
<BR>
ACK-counting to open the window (this is easy and has been documented
<BR>
by someone, right ?)
<BR>

<EM>&gt; I think it is fairly clear that currently, TCP gives abysmal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance in the presence of significant reordering.  (When the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP receiver receives out-of-order packets, the TCP receiver sends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duplicate acknowledgements to tell the TCP sender.  The TCP sender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then does a Fast Retransmit, retransmitting the packet presumed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be lost, and cutting the congestion window at least in half.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is true of Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and SACK TCP, and, I presume, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any TCP implementation more recent that 1988.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that the first step in making TCP more robust to reordering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is in the D-SACK (duplicate-SACK) extension to SACK, &quot;An Extension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) Option for TCP&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;<A HREF="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-sack-00.txt">http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-sack-00.txt</A>&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This has already been approved by the IESG for Proposed Standard,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and is on the RFC editor's to-do queue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a draft paper, &quot;A Report on Some Recent Developments in TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Congestion Control&quot;, that discusses how the D-SACK option could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used to make TCP more robust to reordering.  I am appending an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excerpt from that paper below.  As the excerpt makes clear, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a significant amount of work that would have to be done to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the information in the D-SACK option and come out with viable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tested algorithms that allow TCP to be robust to persistent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reordering...

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From &quot;A Report on Some Recent Developments in TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Congestion Control&quot;:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An initial step towards adding robustness in the presence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unnecessary Retransmit Timeouts and Fast Retransmits is to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the TCP sender the information to determine when an unnecessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Retransmit Timeout or Fast Retransmit has occurred..  This first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; step has been accomplished with the D-SACK (for duplicate-SACK)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension \cite{FMMPR99} that has recently been added to the SACK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP option.  The D-SACK extension allows the TCP data receiver to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use the SACK option to report the receipt of duplicate segments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With the use of D-SACK, the TCP sender can correctly infer the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segments that have been received by the data receiver, including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duplicate segments. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When the sender has retransmitted a packet, D-SACK does not allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP to distinguish between the receipt at the receiver of both the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original and retransmitted packet, and the receipt of two copies  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the retransmitted packet, one of which was duplicated in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network.  If necessary, TCP's timestamp option could be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinguish between these two cases \cite{AP99,L99}.  However, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an environment with minimal packet replication in the network,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; D-SACK allows the TCP sender to make reasonable inferences, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; round-trip time after a packet has been retransmitted, about whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the retransmission was necessary or unnecessary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the TCP data sender determines, a round-trip time after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retransmitting a packet, that the receiver received two copies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that segment and therefore that the packet retransmission was most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely unnecessary, then the sender could have the option of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``undoing'' the halving in the congestion window.  The sender can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``undo'' the recent halving of the congestion window by increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Slow-Start threshold ssthresh to the previous value of the old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congestion window, effectively slow-starting until the congestion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window has reached its old value.  In addition to restoring the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congestion window, the TCP sender could adjust the duplicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acknowledgement threshold or the retransmit timeout parameters, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoid the wasted bandwidth of persistent unnecessary retransmits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The first part of this work, providing the information to the sender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about duplicate packets received at the receiver, is done with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; D-SACK extension.  The next step is to evaluate specific mechanisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for identifying an unnecessary halving of the congestion window,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and for adjusting the duplicate acknowledgement threshold or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retransmit timeout parameters.  Once this is done, there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamental reason why TCP congestion control cannot perform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively in an environment with persistent reordering.
