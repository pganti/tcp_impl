<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; IMO this is not OK even then.  If we call the two machines in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example A (left column) and B (right column), then when B shuts down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for receive, this fact should be pushed back to the application on A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when a write is attempted (eg, EPIPE/SIGPIPE under BSD), but I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see any excuse for tearing down the B-to-A half of the connection as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well.  I don't think an RST should be generated unless the connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is completely gone on B's end - ie, there is no further possibility of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone on that end doing *any* I/O on it.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the only way to push back to A is to generate a RST.  We don't want
<BR>
to ACK the new data, because that implies that the data was accepted.
<BR>
But then you'll never be able to accept the FIN, so you'll never be
<BR>
able to have a graceful close, so why delay the pain?
<BR>
<P>TCP doesn't know what the applications intentions are, or how critical
<BR>
that undelivered data is to the application.  Having TCP try to second
<BR>
guess the application and allow a damaged connection to continue may
<BR>
cause more harm than good, there is just no way for TCP to know that.
<BR>
The best it can do is to let the applications know as soon as possible
<BR>
that an abnormal situation now exists, and the mechanism for that in
<BR>
this situation is a RST.
