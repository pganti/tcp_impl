<P>
Vernon,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; The second prospective on the issue is exactly how useful this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; information would be to an entity attempting to steal or misuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; a connection. Using SNMP to retrieve this information while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; looking at the data flow in real-time to attempt to steal or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; misuse a connection would be challenging for an active connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; since I suspect that the data retrieved via SNMP would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; correlate exactly to the current connection data flow.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If the data are useful for the merely curious, then they are also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;useful for those with &quot;practical&quot; goals.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;More to the point, of what use are those values?  I've long had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jandiced view of what many people call &quot;MIB Mania,&quot; but stuffing not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just the TCP state machine state into a MIB but also the de facto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;congestion avoidance and other state seems over the top even if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't believe the IETF is suffering from MIB Mania.
</EM><BR>
<P>I placed the TCP State information in an optional group exactly
<BR>
because I was concerned with the cost and security issues with
<BR>
respect to this. I don't believe that those objects in the
<BR>
mandatory groups are as debatable but would appreciate some
<BR>
feed back on them as well as the optional group of TCP Connection
<BR>
Table objects.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Never mind the non-trivial costs of keeping all of that information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where it can be gathered by your SNMP code.  Don't worry about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;costs of gathering it.  Never mind the Heisenberg effects of gathering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and reporting it (e.g. consider the effects on the RTT as all of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SNMP packets stack up in router queues).  What are you going to do when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we implement more knobs and buttons?
</EM><BR>
<P>I was thinking that the two groups that AUGMENT the TCP Connection
<BR>
Table would be implemented in separate tables to make it easier
<BR>
for a management application. I can visualize a management application
<BR>
performing a GET-BULK of the entire mandatory group but not the
<BR>
optional group. The optional group of objects are of use in
<BR>
problem determination. You would retrieve a single row in this table
<BR>
as oppose to the whole table. Perhaps some of the objects in the
<BR>
optional group should move to the mandatory one like tcpConnMaxSndWnd
<BR>
for example.
<BR>
<P>As a MIB implementer the cost of implementation is some what
<BR>
invariant with respect to the number of objects. If you have access
<BR>
to the TCP connection information than doing 1 or 50 objects
<BR>
is not that much more. I do agree that the modeling of the data
<BR>
presented needs to be carefully thought out and that use of the
<BR>
data being presented debated.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to determine details the state of a system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, I think that is best done other than with SNMP.  SNMP is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;replacement for all other debugging and remote-access tools.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that SNMP is not the only tool that can nor should be used.
<BR>
It is however the management protocol of the IETF. Weather or not
<BR>
SNMP is used to retrieve management information in particular
<BR>
circumstances is in my opinion implementation dependent and doesn't
<BR>
preclude modeling as MIB objects.
<BR>
<P>What is your opinion with respect to the objects in the mandatory
<BR>
groups? Are there other objects that should be added? Are there
<BR>
objects in the optional group that should move to a mandatory
<BR>
group? Should the optional group be split into categories of objects?
<BR>
Perhaps not all are as controversial.
<BR>
<P>My original posting of objects was not intended to present a
<BR>
final list of objects and their groupings but to determine if there
<BR>
is interest in defining sets of objects to extend the TCP Group.
<BR>
<P>Thanks, Ken
