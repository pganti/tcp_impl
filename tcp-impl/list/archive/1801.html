<P>
Jamshid Mahdavi, Matt Mathis, Matthew Podolsky, Allyn Romanow and
<BR>
I have written an internet-draft about &quot;An Extension to the Selective
<BR>
Acknowledgement (SACK) Option for TCP&quot;, and we are sending it to
<BR>
the tcp-impl list for a final round of feedback before we submit
<BR>
it to the area directors for consideration as an Experimental RFC.
<BR>
(The draft has already incorporated feedback from the end2end-interest
<BR>
mailing list.) The abstract is appended below, and the internet-draft
<BR>
itself is available at
<BR>
&quot;<A HREF="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-sack-00.txt">http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-sack-00.txt</A>&quot;.
<BR>
The main point of the extension is for the TCP data receiver to
<BR>
use SACK blocks to give the TCP data sender more information about
<BR>
duplicate packets that have been received.
<BR>
<P>Our hope is that this proposed draft itself, to add a new type of
<BR>
SACK block in the SACK option, will be relatively uncontroversial.
<BR>
Our belief is that this extension does not introduce any
<BR>
backwards-compatibility issues with existing implementations of
<BR>
SACK TCP (RFC 2018, now at Proposed Standard).  I would note that
<BR>
all of the co-authors of RFC 2018 are also co-authors of this
<BR>
proposed extension.
<BR>
<P>My own expectation is that later research and proposals on specific
<BR>
algorithms for the TCP data sender to in fact *make use of* this
<BR>
SACK option could generate more discussion (and possibly controvery,
<BR>
it is hard to say).  I would hope that this proposal would enable
<BR>
additional work on algorithms for making TCP more robust to reordered
<BR>
packets, ACK loss, packet replication, and/or early retransmit
<BR>
timeouts.
<BR>
<P>Feedback would be appreciated.

<P>An Extension to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) Option for TCP
<BR>
<P>by Sally Floyd, Jamshid Mahdavi, Matt Mathis, Matthew Podolsky, and
<BR>
Allyn Romanow
<BR>
<P>Abstract
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This note defines an extension of the Selective Acknowledgement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(SACK) Option [RFC 2018] for TCP.  RFC 2018 specified the use of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SACK option for acknowledging out-of-sequence data not covered by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP's cumulative acknowledgement field.  This note extends RFC 2018
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by specifying the use of the SACK option for acknowledging duplicate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets.  This note suggests that when duplicate packets are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received, the first block of the SACK option field can be used to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report the sequence numbers of the packet that triggered the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledgement.  This extension to the SACK option allows the TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sender to infer the order of packets received at the receiver,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowing the sender to infer when it has unnecessarily retransmitted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a packet.  A TCP sender could then use this information for more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;robust operation in an environment of reordered packets, ACK loss,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet replication, and/or early retransmit timeouts.
