Looking for a unique investment opportunity?
<BR>
<P>Now you can participate in the fastest growing spectator sport in the United States. 
<BR>
NASCAR racing is getting so big the action is spilling out of the super speedways and
<BR>
onto Wall Street.
<BR>
<P>In 1997, NASCAR event attendance reached 16 million with 150 million T.V. viewers. 
<BR>
New tracks have opened in the west, with NASCAR adding five events in new regions.  It
<BR>
has captured a vast audience looking for a sport in which athletes sign autographs for free
<BR>
and still seem like regular folks.
<BR>
<P>The explosive growth of NASCAR popularity, coupled with the brand loyalty among fans,
<BR>
has created an exciting investment opportunity.  The Motorsports Associated Growth and
<BR>
Income Fund seeks to allow investors the ability to take ownership in the sport of
<BR>
NASCAR.
<BR>
The mutual fund offers investments in companies that derive their primary revenues from
<BR>
operations in auto racing.  The fund also invests in companies that host or sponsor racing
<BR>
events.  With widespread interest, big and small companies are lapping into this hot
<BR>
market.  It is no longer just a venue for beer, tobacco and tires; 70 of the Fortune 500
<BR>
companies from Kodak and McDonald's are taking notice to the exciting growth prospects
<BR>
of this sport.
