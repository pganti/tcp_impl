Hi, all.
<BR>
<P>I am sending (in a separate message) a revision of the internet draft.  I 
<BR>
haven't submitted it to the I-D directory yet, wanting to pass it by everyone 
<BR>
first.
<BR>
<P>There are various minor changes, but there are also some more major changes:
<BR>
<P>1.  &quot;algorithmic&quot; descriptions of both the current and modified Nagle 
<BR>
algorithms.
<BR>
<P>2.  a discussion of implementing Nagle in send() (both current and proposed).
<BR>
<P>3.  an appendix giving some application code providing a model for how 
<BR>
applications might ensure not having their data being subject to Nagle.
<BR>
<P>I think most people wanted &quot;2&quot; above, though i'm still a bit queasy.  I worry 
<BR>
it will generate so much discussion that we won't get to any agreement.
<BR>
<P>Number &quot;3&quot; is *motivated* by Eric Hall's desire to have a warning included for 
<BR>
application developers thinking of disabling Nagle (which is included 
<BR>
separately in the document).  I'd be glad to delete the appendix (though TCP 
<BR>
implementors might want to consider it as a test case outline).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, let me know what you think (not that anyone on this list is shy about 
<BR>
that!).
<BR>
<P>Greg Minshall
