<EM>&gt; My guess would be probably not. The client will be able to send data -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the connection is ESTABLISHED, and that data will likely be accepted and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ACKed. My guess would be that those connections in the listen queue will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stay there for quite a long time.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming client sends data for the ESTABLISHED connection which is queued
<BR>
in the socket receive buffer on the server side and the data fills the
<BR>
buffer, then I presume the client's TCP will never get any ACKs for the
<BR>
additional data sent and will eventually timeout which is the retransmission
<BR>
timeout.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically until the client gets fed-up with a lack of response and closes.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any idea of the situations when it would get fed up.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or, you explicitly accept and close them yourself.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case server won't accept() or close() the connections as it is out
<BR>
of FDs and it will do so only if the FD count goes down. The problem here is
<BR>
that any data sent by client using the ESTABLISHED connection will be put
<BR>
into socket receive buffer and will probably be ACKed. But if I issue an
<BR>
accept() call, it will reap a connection from the listen queue and will
<BR>
overlay the connection onto a FD whose creation will fail as the server is
<BR>
out of FDs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have no guess as to what would happen if you went and did a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listen(s,0) listen(s,1)...
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean to say that I issue an listen(s,0) or listen(s,1) when the server
<BR>
runs out of FDs. We call listen with a backlog of 5 and then wait for any
<BR>
FDs to fire from the select set. I haven't investigated this scenario.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you really want those connections to go away without more direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intervention, you might want to use an interface that inserts the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application between the receipt of the SYN and the sending of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SYN|ACK. I _think_ XTI is or can be such an interface. In that case, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would simply stop taking the request notificatoins and the clients would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timeout on their connects.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is out of question right now with the tight schedules.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you please clarify one more QUESTION?.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any clients SYNs will be put into incomplete connection queue waiting for
<BR>
the three-way handshake to complete. But since the complete connection queue
<BR>
is full, how would TCP handle this scenario. Though it can complete the
<BR>
three-way handshake, it can't move this incomplete connection to the
<BR>
complete connection queue as the queue is full. I guess the server's TCP
<BR>
will not complete the three-way handshake until the complete connection
<BR>
queue has space and those SYNs will be ignored and the clients will timeout
<BR>
after 75 seconds which is the establishment timer.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If both the queues are full, the client's SYN will be ignored and will
<BR>
these clients stop trying after the expiry of establishment timer of 75
<BR>
seconds?.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much for the response.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;regards,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravi.
