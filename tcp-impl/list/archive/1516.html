<P>
Why not parametrize the Nagle?
<BR>
<P>Instead of &quot;allow only one unacknowledged segment&quot;
<BR>
allow &quot;allow N unacknowledged segments/bytes&quot; and 
<BR>
specify recommended range of values.
<BR>
<P>The N=2 would be similar to current proposal and also
<BR>
fix the case where application follows the 
<BR>
&quot;small write, small write, read&quot; operation, 
<BR>
which is not addressed by the proposed draft.
<BR>
<P>The N=2 seems like a good choice, because receivers
<BR>
typically ACK every other packet.

<P><P><EM>&gt; This is at least one extra send operation, which can't be a good thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particularly when the network is over-utilized (or near to it) already.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While this isn't as bad as Rick's example (1461-byte writes), it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still bad utilization. (I'd hate to own the network that did both.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's look at the problem from an application programmer's point of view.
<BR>
You
<BR>
are writing a network application, the transfer pattern can be anything. You
<BR>
notice a performance problem and find that by disabling Nagle algorithm, the
<BR>
problem goes away.  What will you do in the production code?
<BR>
<P>Now with the changed Nagle algorithm, for certain kind of transfer pattern,
<BR>
you do not notice any performance problem.  So you will not turn off Nagle
<BR>
algorithm.  But in fact, the Nagle algorithm may still kick in sometimes and
<BR>
help the network.  Just that you only see the little impact from time to
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P>Nagle algorithm helps a lot in the case of telnet like traffic.  This we
<BR>
should not change.  But for some kind of transfer pattern, it helps a lot if
<BR>
we relax the algorithm.  By doing this, we encourage  application programmer
<BR>
not to disable the algorithm.  IMHO, this is what the  proposed draft is
<BR>
about.  We do not want the algorithm to be disabled in general.  We are
<BR>
making
<BR>
an incentive for programmers not to do that.  At the same time, we do not
<BR>
adversely affect the network.  Imagine what will happen if every application
<BR>
programmers disable the algorithm &quot;by default.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd say that based on this info, it is better to just disable Nagle if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your application is going to be writing small (1.5 segments) chunks, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaving it enabled for applications that do large writes, rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introducing lots of new frames to the network.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is an application can turn the algorithm off any time,
<BR>
regardless
<BR>
of the transfer pattern.  And the proposed change is not to disable the
<BR>
algorithm, but to relax it in some cases.  I'd rather see a slight increase
<BR>
of network traffic in some cases than have most applications turn off the
<BR>
algorithm by default.
<BR>
<P>Solaris's TCP stack has some form of the proposed change for many years.  I
<BR>
have not heard of customer complaints because of it.  At the very least,
<BR>
there was no network meltdown...
