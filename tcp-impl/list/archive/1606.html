<P>
Vern et al,
<BR>
<P>Here are some clarifications; perhaps those who would like to continue
<BR>
the discussion can circulate remaining comments to Vernon and myself
<BR>
&quot;off-line&quot;... 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So what are we supposed to do with the standards based non-answer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course there is no guaranteed correlation between send() and segments,
</EM><BR>
<P>We appear to be tuning Nagle based on some very specific
<BR>
behaviors which are particular to an implementation.
<BR>
<P>Granted, this is (or was) tcp-impl, but that refers to &quot;places where
<BR>
implementations have bugs or stray from the desired behavior&quot;. It does
<BR>
not necessarily mean &quot;constrained to behave like a particular implementation&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let me try to state a pedantic proposition that does not admit standards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exegesis equivocation:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   - in RFC 793, 896, &amp; 1122 TCP conformant implementations which allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      dynamic switching of the Nagle algorithm, turning off Nagle before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      a send() request and on afterwards MAY have identical results in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      segments on the wire as the proposed explicit flush bit.  Moreover,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      all existing implementations that allow dynamic control of the Nagle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      algorithm would have such identical results if the flush bit were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      added to their send() API's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, is that proposition true or false?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not know the answer; if I did, I'd say so.  I do suspect it's true.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is precisely where we differ. While I suspect it may be true
<BR>
for MOST implementations, I firmly claim that an entirely conformant
<BR>
TCP implementation could have different results, and that it would be
<BR>
inappropriate to claim either result as uniquely correct.
<BR>
Adapting Postel's motto and Floyd's position, I am advocating that
<BR>
(excepting bugs, which was where this WG started), we do not 
<BR>
overspecify the behavior of a TCP implementation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was horrified by some of the ideas.  EOF and record markers particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; bother me because they are so trivially implemented by the application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Reliability is also trivially implemented at the app layer, but TCP/IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is preferred to TCP/UDP/IP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you'd step aside from the heat of the rhetorical battle, I hope you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not like that statement.  Reliability requires timers and buffering for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retransmissions, but markers need require no more than a byte count at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the start of the file, record, or block, and never more than simple pattern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition (e.g. escaping) if you don't have the file, record or block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size a priori.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I don't know the sizes ahead of time, I have to do pattern recognition,
<BR>
which is computationally intensive (must examine each byte), and can
<BR>
cause the packet size to increase by up to 50% in the worse cases.
<BR>
Out-of-band indicators, i.e., in the transport protocol, avoid that.
<BR>
<P>The differences between out of band and in-band, application vs. kernel,
<BR>
are all just optimizations. Few, if any of the ones we've described
<BR>
are necessarily of one flavor or another.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;                             Some things are more effectively, efficiently,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or consistently implemented in the transport layer. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hmmm...I wrote &quot;in the application&quot; while you wrote &quot;at the app layer.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>OK. I stepped on a religion button somewhere. We're talking about
<BR>
the same thing - in the application. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've noticed people with .edu addresses on the Southern Calif. coast tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have strong views on the sanctity of Architecture and Network Layers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we are minimalists about architecture, and some would claim
<BR>
that has helped, rather than hurt. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; of their own.  The statement that something is more effective in a layer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes little sense to me. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Would it be better to refer to it as in-band vs. out-of-band? Or &quot;restricted
<BR>
to a common, central implemenation&quot; vs &quot;per application program&quot;? These are
<BR>
the relevant differences to which I, and others using the term 'layer', usually
<BR>
refer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; On the third hand, was in it this mailinglist where Joe Touch and others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; tonight mentioned Gbit/sec TCP for clusters?  Every minor optional feature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that you add to a protocol hurts enormously at the boundaries, on very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; large and fast and on very small systems. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not always - some can be disabled (such as disabling windowing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NO!  ALWAYS!  In the common case, &quot;disabling&quot; involves code in the critical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exection path. 
</EM><BR>
<P>See the Fast Sockets work at Berkeley. You can make almost all your decisions 
<BR>
at connection setup time, and run completely different implementations
<BR>
if you prefer. Even those decisions that are made while an implementation is
<BR>
running need not be made on a per-packet basis, necessarily.
<BR>
<P>Joe
