<BR>
<P><P>Part of the 2002 SCS Western Multiconference on Computer Simulation
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this conference is to serve as a forum for the
<BR>
exchange of ideas among a talented group of international researchers on
<BR>
advances in the design and performance analysis of communication networks
<BR>
and distributed systems.  The conference emphasizes modeling, technical
<BR>
advances and unique applications in the areas of high speed networking,
<BR>
wireless communications, multimedia applications, computer architecture
<BR>
and distributed, parallel and mobile computing systems. The structure of
<BR>
the conference is designed to facilitate collegiality and continuity of
<BR>
discussion among the conference speakers and attendees on the topics
<BR>
covered during the week.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paper sessions are designed to promote discussion of concepts and
<BR>
methodologies based on the presentation of results and innovative
<BR>
modeling, simulation or analysis techniques. The conference grew out of
<BR>
the need to improve the efficiency and quality of models of increasingly
<BR>
complex networks and distributed systems. In addition to the technical
<BR>
sessions, the conference includes invited speakers, vendor presentations
<BR>
and exhibits arranged in conjunction with the 2002 SCS Western Simulation
<BR>
Multiconference (WMC).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original, high-quality technical papers, addressing significant
<BR>
aspects of the design, modeling, or performance analysis of communication
<BR>
networks and distributed systems are solicited for review, possible
<BR>
presentation and subsequent publication in the conference proceedings.
<BR>
Papers that include well-conceived or innovative simulation modeling
<BR>
techniques with strong results and analysis are especially sought.
<BR>
<P>Papers are solicited from not limited to the following topics:
<BR>

<BR>
October 15, 2001		Acceptance Notification.
<BR>
November 15, 2001		Camera Ready Paper Deadline.
<BR>
<P><P>Authors are requested to submit manuscripts electronically to the Program
<BR>
Chair by 11:00 pm (Eastern Time) of the due date via Anonymous ftp
<BR>
directly: ftp.ece.neu.edu:/pub/conf/CNDS/2002/Submissions. Papers can
<BR>
also be uploaded using the Web Site: www.ece.neu.edu/conf/CNDS/2002/.
<BR>
Papers must be in English and submitted files must be in Postscript or PDF
<BR>
format with all figures and tables included. Files names must be unique
<BR>
and reflect the name of the primary author, his or her primary
<BR>
affiliation, the version number of the file and an extension indicating
<BR>
the file type. Multiple versions may be uploaded; however, only the most
<BR>
recent will be reviewed. Filenames are not readable once the file transfer
<BR>
has been completed. Confirmations will be sent to the contact author when
<BR>
the file has been retrieved and successfully viewed or printed. Only
<BR>
original unpublished material will be considered for publication.
<BR>
<P>This year's International TPC is outstanding. Its members represent a
<BR>
broad spectrum of interrelated interests and technical expertise relevent
<BR>
to CNDS including performance analysis, simulation, communications
<BR>
networks, both wired and wireless, mobile computing, computer
<BR>
architecture, distributed systems and more. The TPC consists of newcomers
<BR>
and veterans of CNDS from Universities and Research Labs around the
<BR>
world. Each member is committed to ensure that all submissions are fully
<BR>
refereed for accuracy, technical content, and relevance, and to make this
<BR>
year's conference an exciting International forum for the presentation of
<BR>
high quality work and the exchange of ideas. Papers should be limited to
<BR>
20 double-spaced pages (camera-ready versions are limited to 6
<BR>
single-spaced pages). Authors must include a single page which includes
<BR>
all the authors' names, titles and affiliations, a paper abstract, list of
<BR>
top three relevant topics and contact person information (complete
<BR>
address, email, phone, and fax). Accepted papers will appear in the
<BR>
Conference's Proceedings to be published by the Society for Computer
<BR>
Simulation. Instructions for submitting camera ready papers will be sent
<BR>
to authors following paper acceptance. An award will be presented to the
<BR>
best paper presented at WMC'02. Authors of top papers will also be
<BR>
encouraged to submit a follow-on paper to the International Journal in
<BR>
Computer Simulation. Authors must obtain employer, client, or government
<BR>
releases prior to submittal of the final manuscript.
