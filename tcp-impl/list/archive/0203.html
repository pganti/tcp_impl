</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Comment from the old PC/TCP for DOS days.  In a limited memory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment such as DOS in days gone by, and very possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in various network computers, handheld widgets, etc. in  days to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come, a stack has to balence very carefully network behavior with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The old DOS stack was bound by limitations of memory that caused its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default buffer management to have 3-5 MTU sized packets and 10-20
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NFS RPC sized packets.  That &lt;10K memory chunk was all that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be taken from the system environment without affecting system behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and performance in other ways.
</EM><BR>
<P>An implementation should not advertise an available window larger than
<BR>
what it can actually buffer.
<BR>
<P>Severely memory limited IP aware toaster ovens and other anemic
<BR>
devices need not implement RFC1323 window scaling.  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While its easy to dismiss our old DOS memory issues as obselete, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; underlying issues of low memory TCP implementations will undoubtably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resurface from time to time as TCP is pushed onto smaller and cheaper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices.
</EM><BR>
<P>These machines often had 2-4 MB of memory even in the old days but
<BR>
needed to stuff everything into 640KB for purely stupid reasons.
<BR>
<P>It doesn't matter why these implementations are broken, the fact
<BR>
remains that they are broken and their performance will be poor.  If
<BR>
this leads to the conclusion that it is not possible to implement TCP
<BR>
in a way that TCP will not perform poorly on some hardware platform
<BR>
with too little memory or software platform that can't allocate memory
<BR>
for some reason, then it must simply be accepted that these
<BR>
implementations cannot conform to the RFC and will perform poorly.
