<P>
Is it not true that overprovisioning is never a long term solution, as
<BR>
bandwidth is never ever enough? As Alan says, &quot;Usage expands to fit
<BR>
network bandwidth&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Assuming that the above is true, it becomes necessary to follow one of
<BR>
the below to solve the problem:
<BR>
1. Continue with the present day best effort service and let congestion
<BR>
happen in its non deterministic manner. Users are anyway not complaining
<BR>
about the throughput they are getting today. 
<BR>
<P>2. Given that with Mice connections also congestion has been observed.
<BR>
By Mice, correct me if I am wrong, we mean traffic corresponding to
<BR>
typical request response type of connections, where at most 5 or 6 data
<BR>
TCP packets traverse two way. These first few packets usually get going
<BR>
in the slowstart phase of congestion control. And slowstart is by
<BR>
definition itself non-aggressive. But if congestion is happening at this
<BR>
stage itself, it clearly means that even slow start is aggressive enough
<BR>
for a heavily loaded Internet. So, question is , should there be an
<BR>
added term in the slow start equation that slows it down further. The
<BR>
counter argument would be that, the user experience may suck as a result
<BR>
of the added term.
<BR>
<P>3.  Going by a per TCP connection strategy(2 above) to reduce
<BR>
congestion may not be an effective way of solving the problem. As each
<BR>
individual TCP may not have the information to accurately determine the
<BR>
state of the path to its destination. Logically, a third party may be in
<BR>
a better position to dynamically measure bandwidth utilization and make
<BR>
this information available to all the TCPs, then overall throughput may
<BR>
be better. Is it worth considering separating out congestion control
<BR>
from TCP Data flow and treat it as a separate protocol &quot;building block&quot;,
<BR>
(like a routing protocol perhaps) that calculates and stores information
<BR>
about the state of the network in a distributed manner, which can then
<BR>
be used by individual TCPs? Ofcourse, this is not backward compatible.
<BR>
But if feasible, this would scale.
<BR>
<P>4. QoS is another option too. But the basis for differentiating service
<BR>
would be user priority or the SLA. This model does not take into
<BR>
consideration the congestion factor and hence will not be effective for
<BR>
all. 
<BR>
<P>Any comments would be welcome,
<BR>
<P>thanks

<EM>&gt; Economic reality #1: Usage expands to fit network bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<P>Usage expands to fit available bandwidth when bandwidth is limited. 
<BR>
Granted that's the case on most links (like most highways), which are 
<BR>
deployed (by design) to barely keep pace with demand.
<BR>
<P>There are plenty of cases where this isn't true, however. Bandwidth can
<BR>
<P>be overprovisioned; it just usually isn't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Economic reality #2: People will pay more for QoS - right now via

private
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 		     IP networks

<P>More specifically:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will pay more to avoid commercials and get higher
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bandwidth.
<BR>
<P>Users haven't been paying for anything sophisticated enough to call
<BR>
QoS.
