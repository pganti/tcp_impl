<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That being the case, most of the rest of the time, the problems I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; seen with applications (such as web servers) has been that they are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making &quot;apropriate&quot; calls to send their data - for instance, sending the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; http headers and the http data in separate calls to send() instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one call to writev() or something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are other problems - not disabling Nagle, not correcting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socket buffer sizes, etc...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree about the socket buffer sizes, but I'm not fololowing you on
<BR>
Nagle - why should a web server disable Nagle if it is presenting the
<BR>
http headers and data to the transport at the same time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Put another way, all &quot;logically associated&quot; (I am sure there is a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; term) data should be presented to the transport at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's an artifact of leaving Nagle's algorithm on (by default), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to anticipate it at the application layer.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have thought that presenting as much data to the transport was
<BR>
goodness in and of itself and did not imply applications trying to
<BR>
anticipate an implementation specific?
<BR>
<P>OK, sitting here typing I think I may have figured-out one area you
<BR>
might consider disabling Nagle. Were you alluding to pipelined requests?
<BR>
I could see where three http requests sent on a single connection could
<BR>
have the second and third delayed if they were smaller that MSS/2 (I
<BR>
guess that generalizes to MSS/(N-1)?)
<BR>
<P>That being the case, should Nagle be disabled, or would it be better to
<BR>
have the application tell the transport that there will be no more data
<BR>
coming for a while - &quot;fflush&quot; for a TCP connection? 
<BR>
<P>Same question for the server.
<BR>
<P>rick jones
<BR>
<P>Even with Nagle on, I would think that pipelined requests &quot;degenerate&quot;
<BR>
into nothing worse than one at a time, with the added connectoin
<BR>
overhead, and sometimes have more than one at a time, so it is still
<BR>
goodness right?
