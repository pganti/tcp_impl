<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When you can open a connection to the server you get as many guesses as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want for a secret refresh period (a few minutes). You know one ISN, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithm to generate it and a lot of the input parameters (your IP, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; port, etc.). Unknown is just the secret.  When there are not too many 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibilities for the secret you can brute force it, checking it against 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your single ISN. When you can make the brute force attack quicker than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the secret refresh you win. When the server is handicaped in its secret
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation (e.g. diskless or no disk io during normal operation, no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware rnd, no user keyboard input) like most servers you'll likely win 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a much longer time and you can extend the brute force attack over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer times.
</EM><BR>
<P>What's that about a &quot;secret refresh period&quot; for the secret used to
<BR>
generate ISN's?  When I've implemented RFC 1948 and other anti-ISN-guessing
<BR>
schemes, I've never built such a thing.  It sounds like a bad idea.
<BR>
<P>If the secret includes the microsecond or nanosecond tick when the SYN
<BR>
arrived, how does the attacker benefit from discovering the secret in use
<BR>
when that ISN was chosen?  I guess with enough such brute force efforts,
<BR>
the bad guy might learn about the addresses in your buffer pool and the
<BR>
distribution of your interrupt latency.  However, that your interrupt latency
<BR>
is between 50 and 500 usec is not likely to be much of a secret.  If your
<BR>
system vendor is serious, it's in the manual.  The secret is for each ISN
<BR>
is how many nanoseconds your clock thinks elapsed, which not even you
<BR>
clock knows in advance.  (again, see NTP discussions)  And which buffer
<BR>
was used that time, which depends on other traffic.
<BR>
<P>That your clock might contribute 10 or 20 instead of 30 and your
<BR>
buffer pool only 3 to 10 bits of entropy does not imply that you
<BR>
have the 0 bits of entropy of a constant secret.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entropy pools are usually not only used for ISNs, but for a lot of other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things (like SSL or PGP session keys). For these I would worry even on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LAN. Splitting the entropy pool into less security critical (like ISNs) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and more security critical (like session keys) is probably not practical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so you have to design the entropy pool input for the worst case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but I thought we were talking about ISN's instead of cryptographically
<BR>
secure random numbers for such as SSL, PGP, and IPSec.
<BR>
<P>If I were to implement RFC 1948 support in a system with an &quot;entropy
<BR>
pool&quot; such as is commonly used for /dev/random, I would only use
<BR>
the entropy pool as part of the secret for generating an ISN.
<BR>
I would also add other sources of entropy such as the microsecond
<BR>
tick of the SYN's arrival and the buffer address of the SYN.
<BR>
<P>By the way, if you do use the familiar MD5 in the RFC, I think it's
<BR>
much faster to concentrate all of the bits and reduce once.
<BR>
MD5Update() has noticeable fixed overhead.
<BR>
<P>And yes, I was wrong about the Birthday Paradox.  If 16 bits of the ISN
<BR>
are randomized (e.g. if you like the BSD clocking defense against
<BR>
overlapping windows), then each attack has a 1 in 2**16 chance of success.
<BR>
The attacker must send about 50,000 probes to have a 50% chance of
<BR>
success.  If you follow RFC 1948 to the letter and give up the BSD
<BR>
robustness, the bad guy must send about 1,000,000,000 probes for a 50%
<BR>
probability of success.
<BR>
(ok--did I mess that up too?  (1-1/(2^16))^50000 is about 0.5)
<BR>
