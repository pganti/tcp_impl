<EM>&gt; &gt; My understanding of &quot;the way things are supposed to work&quot; :) is that if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that one-and-a-fraction MSS-worth of data was presented to the TCP in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; single &quot;send&quot; that all of it should go out without delay. And yes, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could mean a series of 1460,1,1460,1 segments traversing the network. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; demonstrated that being the case with a quick netperf TCP_RR test with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;-r 1461,1&quot; - if the paragraphs description was correct, I should have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only gotten ~5 transactions per second (200 ms delayed ACK), but I got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; several hundred.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is interesting.  So are you saying that the receiver did not delay acks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in your test case?  Assuming MSS is 1460 bytes.  After the sender sends the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first 1460 bytes of the 1461 bytes request (in a single send call), it cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send any more because of Nagle.  And if the receiver implements delay ack and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ack every other segment, it will not send back an ack immediately if the 1460
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bytes segment happen to be the first of the 2 segments.  Have you looked at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the transfer trace to see what is going on?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I'm saying that the last byte did not wait for the ack to go out -
<BR>
the Nagle check was applied to the &quot;send&quot; as a whole, not the individual
<BR>
segments that made up the &quot;send.&quot;
