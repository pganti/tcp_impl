As an asside - I suspect there may be differing definitions of what
<BR>
pathological means/implies :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Reordering has a certain probability of triggering fast retransmit -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the session has four or more packets outstanding (relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unusual) 
</EM><BR>
<P>Wouldn't four or more segments outstanding on a
<BR>
session/connection/flow/whatever :) being relatively unusual imply that
<BR>
there would relatively little improvment (for that
<BR>
session/connection/flow/whatever) from a load balancing scheme that
<BR>
spreads packets of a given session/connection/flow/whatever across
<BR>
multiple links?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and drops the first, the duplicate acks resulting from its successors 
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you mean to say &quot;reorders the first&quot; here since dropping the first
<BR>
would (?) have the same behaviour between load-balanced and
<BR>
non-load-balanced links?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you want to re-design fast retransmit to do so better, such as is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done in New Reno or in SACK, I'm all for that. But I really don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that the network behaviors which might eliminate reordering are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improvements. They require the network to support additional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexity, which itself is prone to failures, and their cure may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worse than the disease.
</EM><BR>
<P>Should we distinguish between eliminating reordering and not doing
<BR>
things that may reorder as a frequent matter of course?
