<P><EM>&gt; If you think about it for a momenet, that reasoning is obviously incorrect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It assumes that everyone is required to read all IETF documents.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the point of Last Call - if you care about where the IETF is going,
<BR>
you are supposed to read <A HREF="mailto:ietf-announce@ietf.org?Subject=Re:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;199909151616.JAA18502@daffy.ee.lbl.gov&gt;">ietf-announce@ietf.org</A> and see what is being
<BR>
proposed.  You don't have to read all the documents, just the ones that
<BR>
appear relevant.  The abstract of RFC 2474 is clear that the document is
<BR>
about redefining the TOS byte.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since getting anything changed during Last Call is at best difficult
</EM><BR>
<P>The WG raised the issue of what depends on the current structure of the TOS
<BR>
byte at length, had considerable discussion, and no one brought up the TCP
<BR>
incompatibility.  It's not as though it wasn't high profile - 400+ people
<BR>
attend each diffserv meeting.  But even so, it was on the radar as a
<BR>
significant issue, and I think it would have been treated very seriously
<BR>
as a last call comment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Instead of requiring changes to an unknown but apparently significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of existing TCP implementations and literally uncountable TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installations, why not strengthen the DiffServ words about upward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatibility?
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the key questions is: is it really a significant number of TCP
<BR>
implementations?  That's why this discussion should happen on tcp-impl.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the RFC 1349/RFC 1812 values of the IP TOS byte were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required to be get through unchanged (after possibly having been mapped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to other values and back again), would any existing combinations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications and host break?
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you know what to map them back to?  It's not a one-to-one mapping.
<BR>
