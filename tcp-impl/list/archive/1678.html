&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included message from <A HREF="mailto:mrosu@us.ibm.com?Subject=Re:%20Counting%20ACKs%20in%20NewReno&In-Reply-To=&lt;85256737.00221895.00@D51MTA03.pok.ibm.com&gt;">mrosu@us.ibm.com</A>:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try another example.  Using your notation, cwnd = 5,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1] 2 [3] 4 5
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fast retransmitting seg 1, partial ack for seg 2 comes back.  Then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dup_ack_cnt -= 2 - 1 = 2.  (I hope I get it right this time (-:)  So
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using your idea, since dup_ack_cnt &lt; 3, seg 3 will not be retransmitted.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cwnd is set to 5 - 2 + 1 = 3.  So no new segment can be sent.  TCP has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to time out.
<BR>
<P>Yes, you're right...
<BR>
However, in my original message, under Example 1, I say:
<BR>
&quot;....If we want to be more aggressive and count the retransmission of
<BR>
segment 1 as a segment sent after 7 but acked before 7, then the new
<BR>
value of dupacks should be 2....&quot;
<BR>
<P>I was trying to say that you can be more aggressive for the second
<BR>
retransmission. The more aggressive algorithm won't timeout on
<BR>
&quot;[1] 2 [3] 4 5&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Here is a better way to count fast retransmissions as messages sent after X
<BR>
but acked before X:
<BR>
<P>Enter in fast retransmit phase and retransmit if dupacks &gt;= 3.
<BR>
Upon receiving a partial ACK, always decrement dupacks by (# segs_acked - 1)
<BR>
and:
<BR>
if this would be the 2nd fast retransmit, then retransmit if dupacks &gt;= 2,
<BR>
or if this would be the 3rd fast retransmit, then retransmit if dupacks &gt;= 1,
<BR>
otherwise, retransmit unconditionally.
<BR>
<P>I believe that you can prove that the shortest three examples for which the
<BR>
aggressive algorithm timeouts are the following: [1] 2 3 4 [5] [6] 7,
<BR>
[1] 2 3 4 [5] 6 [7], and [1] 2 3 4 [5] [6] [7]. The main observation is that
<BR>
while in the fast retransmit phase, cwnd is always &gt;= cwnd0/2, where cwnd0
<BR>
is the initial congestion window (before the congestion event).
<BR>
<P>Using the same observation, you can prove that the aggressive algorithm
<BR>
timeouts after the first retransmit only if 1/2 of the window or more is
<BR>
lost (in the examples above, at least 3 messages are lost for a window of 7).
<BR>
NewReno won't timeout if 1/2 window or more is lost.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can separate your modification into 2 cases.  Using NewReno's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms, partial ack and ack covers recover.  Firstly, I don't believe that it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is &quot;risky&quot; at all in retransmitting the first unack'ed segment after getting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a partial ack.  Fast retransmit is triggered because of 3 dup acks.  We
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assume that there is no reordering, thus the segment is really dropped.  This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means that no partial ack or complete ack can be sent back until this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropped segment is retransmitted and received by the receiver.  Thus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmitting a segment because of a partial ack is as &quot;risky&quot; as the first
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast retransmission.  They are all linked together.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose for the moment, we just apply half of your idea, do the dup_ack_cnt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculation but relax the dup_ack_cnt &gt;= 3 rule.  If after leaving fast
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmit phase, dup_ack_cnt is still &gt; 0, can we infer that some of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new segments sent during fast retransmit phase are also dropped?  I'll say
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......
<BR>
<P>OK, lets separate my proposal in two cases and apply only part of the idea.
<BR>
In the fast retransmit phase upon receiving a partial ACK, adjust dupacks as
<BR>
I proposed and retransmit unconditionally (because it is safe to assume
<BR>
the segment was lost after at least one roundtrip).
<BR>
Upon receiving a full ACK, adjust dupacks as I proposed. If dupacks &gt; 0, use
<BR>
it to determine the start of a new fast retransmit phase.
<BR>
<P>I believe that if you filter window updates correctly, a positive value
<BR>
of dupacks upon leaving the fast retransmit is a pretty safe indication of
<BR>
a lost segment.
<BR>
If ACKs are lost on their way back to the source, dupacks underestimates
<BR>
the number of segments received out of order.
<BR>
Why do you say 'probably'?
<BR>
<P><EM>   &gt;I don't see the benefit of clearing the dupacks counter. Please elaborate.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dup_ack_cnt is just an implementation detail in NewReno which is used to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify when fast retransmit start and ends.  Reseting it to 0 just means
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is the end.
<BR>
<P>Comparing against the current value of the 'recover' variable will do the same.
<BR>
I assume that 'recover' is never cleared; only set when fast retransmit starts.
<BR>
<P><EM>   &gt;When there are no losses, the dupacks counter will go to zero rapidly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>   &gt;Because of lost acks, there will be attempts to decrement the counter
</EM><BR>
<EM>   &gt;below zero. Anyway, dupacks should always be &gt;= 0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>   &gt;No. The congestion window should be handled as in the current draft.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, my intention is to ask when you stop the fast retransmit phase.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you stop only when dup_ack_cnt becomes 0 or a time out happens?  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason I ask is that a fast retransmit phase covers a single congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event.
<BR>
<P>You stop the current retransmit phase upon receiving a full ACK. Adjust cwnd
<BR>
as the draft says and adjust dupacks as I suggested. If updated dupacks &gt;= 3,
<BR>
start a new retransmit phase; follow steps 1 and 2 in the draft. Clear dupacks
<BR>
only if negative (if ACKs are lost, my algorithm for adjusting dupacks can
<BR>
yield negative values).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If cwnd is adjusted as in the draft, the loss of a new segment sent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during fast retransmit phase is treated as the same congestion event.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd suggest cwnd needs to be decremented when recovering for segments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent beyond recover.
<BR>
<P>Upon receiving a full or partial ACK, cwnd should be adjusted as specified in
<BR>
the draft.
