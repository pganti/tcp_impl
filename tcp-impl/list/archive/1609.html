<EM>&gt; From: &quot;Eric A. Hall&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ehall@ehsco.com?Subject=Re:%20dynamic%20rwin%20adjustments&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902240043.RAA22527@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">ehall@ehsco.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anybody doing anything with dynamic default rwin sizes? Like, if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incoming connection request is from a local node whose RTT is already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; known, set window for X? or, probably better, if connection request is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a remote system with no defined route, assume high-latency RTT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equal to previous remote connections and set rwin to X?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why bother, at least using tactics like those?  The RTT is only one of
<BR>
the parameters for computing the window size that gives you maximum
<BR>
throughput.  Given an RTT of 1 msec, 100 msec or 100 usec, what window
<BR>
would you recommend?  Besides, for many TCP connections, more throughput
<BR>
than can be provided by 4 MSS worth of window is useless and will not and
<BR>
cannot be used.
<BR>
<P>What resources are you conserving or better utilizing by adjusting your
<BR>
window?  Why not just advertise a 2 GByte receive window for all
<BR>
connections?  I can see two reasons, worst case buffer space used and the
<BR>
buffer space in the router(s) just beyond the big bottleneck(s) in the
<BR>
path.  You care about the former because it's not nice to have a packet
<BR>
arrive when you have nowhere to put it.  You might care about the latter,
<BR>
because having a lot of bytes waiting in that router means they're more
<BR>
likely to be discarded or to contribute to latency on your other incoming
<BR>
traffic.   However, the other guy's congestion window is also supposed to
<BR>
worry about such things.
<BR>
<P>The paper recently mentioned here about dynamically adjusting receive
<BR>
windows looks interesting.  As I understand it, their idea is to adjust
<BR>
receive windows based on the out-going congestion window and/or recent
<BR>
receive throughput and a notion of fairness.  Their plan seems intended
<BR>
to give every connection the largest window that maximizes total system
<BR>
throughput, while honoring the familiar operating system notion of fairness
<BR>
or at least avoiding starvation.  (I'd repeat the URL of the paper, but
<BR>
I think I've lost it.)
