<EM>&gt; From: John Hanley &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jh@yahoo-inc.com?Subject=Re:%20slow-start%20bit&In-Reply-To=&lt;199905171715.MAA04837@frantic.bsdi.com&gt;">jh@yahoo-inc.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about just causing the receiver to never delay ACK if more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `threshold' time has elapsed since the last ACK sent by the receiver?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly `threshold' would be &lt; 200ms; I'm thinking around 100ms or 50ms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it is much less than sender's RTO interval, then receiver would effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suppress delayed ACK *without* the sender signaling that in an option bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many years ago I put the slow-start code into UNICOS.  The poor
<BR>
interaction between the initial packet during slow-start and the
<BR>
delayed ACK/ACK every other packet stratagey became quite obvious,
<BR>
both at connection startup and after the connection had been idle
<BR>
for awhile and the sender restarted slow-start.  There are two ways
<BR>
to address this.  Either the receiver doesn't delay ACKs during
<BR>
slow-start, or the sender sends more than 1 packet to get past the
<BR>
ack every other packet strategy.
<BR>
<P>I figured that I couldn't change all the other TCPs out there, and
<BR>
since either one will improve throughput, I implemented the reciever
<BR>
changes.  When a connection was first opened, I immediatly acked the
<BR>
first N packets (actually, first N*maxseg bytes) , and then went back
<BR>
to the ack-every-other-packet strategy.  I chose N=8 for no particular
<BR>
reason, other than it was a power of 2, and 16 seemed too big.  I didn't
<BR>
just use N=2, because it helps to get through slow-start when you ACK
<BR>
every packet, and with N=8 you can get through a couple of round-trip
<BR>
times before going back to ack-every-other-packet.  It worked fine, so
<BR>
there never was any reason to change it.
<BR>
<P>The actual implementation took IRS and added N*maxseg to it.  As long
<BR>
as data arrived with a seq number less than that, it was immediatly
<BR>
acked.  Once we passed that point, the pointer was pulled along
<BR>
equal to seg.rcv_next.  Then, in TCP input, if the idle counter
<BR>
got large enough to kick in slow-start, I reset the value to
<BR>
seg.rcv_next + N*maxseg, so that packets would be immediatly ACKed
<BR>
again.
<BR>
<P>The nice thing was that with these changes our throughput improved
<BR>
both in Cray-&gt;Cray transfers, and other-&gt;Cray transfers.
<BR>
<P>Combine those receiver changes with the new initial window of 4K,
<BR>
(see RFC 2414), and you can eliminate a lot of the artificial
<BR>
delays due to bad delayed ACK interaction.
<BR>
<P>I don't see a need for a &quot;slow start&quot; bit.  Effectivly it would be
<BR>
a &quot;please ACK immediatly&quot; bit, and would be ripe for abuse by
<BR>
setting it in every packet, in which case you'd have to put in code
<BR>
to determine whether or not the bit is legitimate, which by the
<BR>
way would be similar code to what I've just described, so just
<BR>
skip the bit.
