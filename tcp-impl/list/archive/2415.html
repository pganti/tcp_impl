<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; So I'd like to do something so that outgoing connections for which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the application has not specified a source address don't always try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; with one source address and give up if that doesn't work;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; conceptually, I'd like to try from all local addresses.  I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thinking of sending out multiple SYNs, [...]
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem is what routing protocols were designed for.  When a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destination subnet is unreachable, packets will be routed to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second provider (assuming that provider has a route to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destination and back to you).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what you mean; perhaps I didn't describe the problem in
<BR>
enough detail.
<BR>
<P>Let's give a concrete example.  My home mailserver,
<BR>
twig.rodents.montreal.qc.ca, is at 132.206.78.3 and 216.46.5.3.  The
<BR>
off-LAN gateway is stone, 132.206.78.33 and 216.46.5.9.  Twig's default
<BR>
route points to 216.46.5.9; if twig initiates a connection, it will
<BR>
come from 216.46.5.3.
<BR>
<P>Something went wrong recently with a router on the path from the
<BR>
outside world to 216.46.5.3 (packets can get out but can't get back in,
<BR>
though for these purposes it might as well have fallen over entirely).
<BR>
216.46.5.3 can reach anything on the near side of that router;
<BR>
132.206.78.3 can reach anything else - but neither address can reach
<BR>
any host the other one can.  (I've put a bug in the ear of the relevant
<BR>
techies; it may have been fixed by the time you read this for all I
<BR>
know.)  Incoming connections to 216.46.5.3 from beyond the dead router
<BR>
time out, but 132.206.78.3 works; for hosts on the near side of it, the
<BR>
converse is true.
<BR>
<P>How is a routing protocol supposed to deal with this?  Remember, my
<BR>
house LAN doesn't have its own AS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Varying the source address, to force packets onto the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provider, is a solution.  But it doesn't scale
</EM><BR>
<P>In what sense does it not scale?  Doesn't scale to a larger house LAN?
<BR>
Doesn't scale to more than a few addresses per host?  Doesn't scale in
<BR>
that it would be a disaster if every multihomed host did it?  What?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I may have missed something in your solution, but I think you mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'd only try one source address from the second subnet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  (Actually, I would probably have the code try once per address
<BR>
the machine has, which in my case has the same effect.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sending multiple SYNs from multiple addresses on the same subnet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't help.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not convinced; I've seen cases where one host is reachable and the
<BR>
host next to it isn't.  (Not often, mind you.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd like to know why the block of addresses goes unreachable before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proposing a solution.  Try some traceroutes from each subnet when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this happens.  It could be network congestion, route flaps, crashes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. I've had providers mysteriously lose routes back to me at times.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, I know what happened, in a functional sense: a router went wonky,
<BR>
incorrectly returning host unreachables for inbound (ie, to my house
<BR>
LAN) packets.  Perhaps it just lost a route; perhaps it broke more
<BR>
seriously - I don't know details.
