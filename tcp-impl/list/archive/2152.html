Doesn't Defragmentation belongs in the IP layer; if you make that
<BR>
assumption, then you could make life easier for that layer by sending
<BR>
the last fragment first; the receiver then knows what resources are
<BR>
required to reassemble.
<BR>
<P>As an outsider looking in; it would seem to me TCP/IP started out a very
<BR>
elegant general purpose protocol. It allowed for out of order delivery;
<BR>
multiple packet delivery and made no assumption on the packet size that
<BR>
the underlying medium could handle. It has become more and more complex;
<BR>
and less and less robust ( complexity brings bugs) as people try to get
<BR>
additional speed out of systems that don't need a protocol that is as
<BR>
robust as TCP/IP was.
<BR>
<P>Fast retransmit for example making assumptions that are just not valid
<BR>
in the general case.
<BR>
<P>I am also a little confused as too why out of order packet delivery is
<BR>
an issue with the ever decreasing cost of processors. It for example
<BR>
costs very little to have a NIC reassemble fragmented IP packets before
<BR>
delivery to the general purpose CPU.
<BR>
<P>Granted sorting out the IP order is a little more complex, but even
<BR>
there if rules where made to have the IP identifier indicate the order
<BR>
it would not have been a big deal; the NIC could have handled it; but
<BR>
that was not to be.
<BR>
<P>If you have to move to the TCP sequence number to sort out packet order
<BR>
then surely all is lost.
<BR>
1) TCP is one of many possible protocols handled by IP.
<BR>
2) You are using in a low layer something that has nothing to do with
<BR>
that layer, more complexity more bugs.
<BR>
<P>If  you send packets in parallel surly it would be better to add a
<BR>
sequence number  when dividing the input stream up, then use and remove
<BR>
that sequence number when putting it back together, assuming you have
<BR>
control over how the stream is put back together.
<BR>
<P>Given the way the US patent system is going it is probable something as
<BR>
simple and obvious as this that is about to be patented. Perhaps this is
<BR>
today's solution, but not tomorrow's.
<BR>
<P>If you haven't got control of reassemble, then I would have thought that
<BR>
was the very application IP was initially designed to handle, and the
<BR>
bits added as time has passed are the problem.
<BR>

<P><EM>&gt; Recent discussions on this list focused on network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices reordering packets. How about an end-host
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that intentionally reorders some TCP packets?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; During testing of Packet Classification capability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on for Diffserv-capable routers, one of my colleagues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discovered that the Linux TCP sender intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reorders fragments - the pkt containing the TCP port
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number is the last pkt sent in a family (same ip_id)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of fragments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The implication of such an implementation is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Layer-4 packet classification of fragments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is virtually impossible - unless routers try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cache packets....not a desirable solution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course one could argue that most fragments on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the net are UDP and not TCP but nonetheless:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shouldn't end-hosts avoid intentional reordering?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We checked out various RFCs and didn't find explicit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prohibitions on an end-host reordering the pkts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it sends out.
