Hello;
<BR>
<P>I sent an eMail to Jack McGann asking a question about IPv6 Path MTU
<BR>
Discovery.  I had a question about how it was described, and thought I had
<BR>
an idea for a better solution.  Mr. McGann answered saying that he didn't
<BR>
know if that had been considered, and suggested I distribute it in this
<BR>
forum.
<BR>
<P>Here is the eMail I sent Mr. McGann - please feel free to contact me for
<BR>
questions and to let me know what you think.
<BR>
<P>Best regards;
<BR>

Hello Mr. McCann;
<BR>
I have read with interest &quot;IPv6 Clearly Explained&quot;, by Pete Loshin. I read
<BR>
about the Path MTU Discovery process and I had a question. I went to the
<BR>
IETF site and researched the RFC, and I have a thought.
<BR>
The book, and the RFC, describe the process is described as the source node
<BR>
sending the largest packet permissible on it's own network - essentially the
<BR>
first hop. If any intervening link cannot handle packets that large, it
<BR>
discards the packet and sends a ICMPv6 &quot;packet too big&quot; message to the
<BR>
source. The source node drops the size of the packet to within that reported
<BR>
limit, and send the packet again. Perhaps it makes the final destination,
<BR>
perhaps another node requires even a smaller packet size, and generates
<BR>
another &quot;packet too big&quot; message for the source. This could go on for
<BR>
awhile.
<BR>
My question is this. Why not have each node in the path that supports only a
<BR>
smaller MTU than the source node send the &quot;packet too big&quot; message, but
<BR>
still forward a &quot;shell packet&quot; on towards the destination, where the &quot;shell
<BR>
package&quot; contains the minimum MTU so far along that path. Since the goal is
<BR>
to send a packet all the way to the destination, that information may well
<BR>
be needed, and it would reduce latency in a scenario where there was a
<BR>
&quot;stepping down&quot; of the MTU size allowed by intervening links as the packets
<BR>
approached the destination.
<BR>
The source node would simply wait, collecting whatever &quot;packet still too
<BR>
big&quot; ICMP messages it received from the intervening nodes (a node that could
<BR>
accommodate the current MTU would simply forward the shell packet forward,
<BR>
but would not reply to the source node), until it received a confirmation
<BR>
from the true destination that the packet had finally arrives. Looking over
<BR>
the ICMP &quot;packet too big&quot; messages the source had received, it could now
<BR>
choose the best possible MTU and proceed with confidence.
<BR>
Heck - we could even have the &quot;shell packet&quot; continue all the way to the
<BR>
destination node, being adjusted downward by each link along the way (if
<BR>
needed) - without generating any ICMP &quot;packet too big&quot; messages - and then
<BR>
make the true destination node send a message back to the source saying &quot;a
<BR>
2785byte MTU is cleared all the way through&quot;, at which time the real data
<BR>
transmission would begin. You would probably want the very first node that
<BR>
determined it needed a smaller packet generate the ICMP &quot;packet too big&quot;
<BR>
message for the source, just to let the source know it wasn't going to be
<BR>
clear sailing. It could mark the &quot;shell packet&quot; it sent forward to
<BR>
downstream nodes so they knew they weren't the first to demand a smaller
<BR>
MTU.
<BR>
What do you think? Good idea? I'll bet you guys thought of this - just
<BR>
trying to help. You at the IETF are doing a great job.
