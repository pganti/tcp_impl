I talked with Van about slow-start after idle issues.  His basic argument is:
<BR>
any time you've lost the ack clock, you need to recover it, and the mechanism
<BR>
for doing so is a slow-start.  So after 1 RTO (at which point you don't expect
<BR>
any more feedback from the receiver), you need to begin a new slow-start, just
<BR>
as though you were beginning a new connection.
<BR>
<P>There may be room in the future for introducing pacing techniques that
<BR>
supplement the ack clock.  But this is TCP research, and out of scope
<BR>
for tcp-impl.
<BR>
<P>So my leaning is that for the RFC 2001 revision, we add a description of
<BR>
slow-start after 1 RTO idle, with a window the same as the initial connection
<BR>
window.  The behavior you described is indeed a bug, probably one that's
<BR>
very easy to make, and should be written up as such.  Clearly, we will need
<BR>
to be careful in our description of what exactly &quot;1 RTO idle&quot; means.
