Rick,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess I would be in the camp that feels that interpreting nagle send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by send is sufficient and the way to go and that we need to make sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; app writers understand just what they are doing when they set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP_NODELAY. A &quot;mantra&quot; along the lines of &quot;provide as much of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logically associated data as you can to the transport at one time&quot; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something... 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think two things.
<BR>
<P>One, i don't think application writers can always guarantee that even if they 
<BR>
get the write buffer size, all the data will be exempt from Nagle.  For 
<BR>
example, in the BSD stack at least, if you pass too much data for the current 
<BR>
(congestion or whatever) window in your send() call, subsequent packets may be 
<BR>
subject to Nagle (thus susceptible to bad interactions with delayed ACKs at 
<BR>
the remote side).  Check out, for example, John Heideman's article in the 
<BR>
April, 1997, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review, or Henrik Nielsen, et 
<BR>
al, from SIGCOMM 1997, for example of fairly well-crafted applications that 
<BR>
still run afoul of Nagle/delayed ACK interactions.
<BR>
<P>Two, i think that making this change may have the effect of preventing people 
<BR>
from wholesale disabling of Nagle.
<BR>
<P>(I also think i'm happy to have the change apply to &quot;send()s&quot;, as is quite 
<BR>
often current practice, rather than to the output of TCP.  I think, though, 
<BR>
that it should be *written* as if it applies to the output of TCP, just as 
<BR>
RFC896.)
<BR>
<P>Does that make sense?
<BR>
<P>Cheers,  Greg
