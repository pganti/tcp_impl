<EM>&gt; whoa!  The way I read 1122 and friends MSL is to be set to 2 minutes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it would take an act of God and Jon postel to change it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought they were one and the same.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On rescanning 1122 quickly I see it notes that it was set arbitarily to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2 minutes but I seem to recall some serious math around slow WAN links
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leading tyo that 2 minute figure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two minutes seems very high, but the results of being too low can be quite
<BR>
unpleasant. If you start an ACK fight between two low rtt T3's you will
<BR>
often cripple the routers on the network and damage the link for others. 
<BR>
Furthermore no flow control is applying at this point. You get a bit of
<BR>
whatever fair queuing the router is trying but no VJ to save you.
<BR>
<P>RFC1337 showed that this case is hard to cause and fixes some problems with
<BR>
TIME_WAIT but not all, and Ian Heavans found more. The fact these problems
<BR>
though always present almost never occur perhaps indicates we are safer than it
<BR>
looks.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't like to assume such a conclusion until someone with a decent
<BR>
footing in queuing theory and probability worked it out. It could be that
<BR>
the data corruption probability is actually lower than the odds of a bad
<BR>
but correctly checksummed packet and that the ACK fight one is either very
<BR>
unlikely or can be cured by some simple ack rate limiting.
<BR>
<P><P>And now a completely unrelated topic. What constraints are people putting
<BR>
on believing RST frames and ICMP returns. Attacks based on these are getting
<BR>
somewhat more common, especially one real nasty that IPSEC doesnt really
<BR>
solve either - people spoofing ICMP fragmentation needed MTU = 68 type
<BR>
responses.
