<EM>&gt;  not sure that keepalive helps the situation :-) but the more memory in a
</EM><BR>
<P>Depending on the type of keepalive - TCP keepalives can help the
<BR>
&quot;FIN_WAIT_2&quot; scenario. Http keepalives gives you a lower TCP connection
<BR>
rate for a given URL retrieval rate, which depending on your URL
<BR>
retrieval rate and all might keep your TCP connection rate from
<BR>
exceeding some arbitrary limit on the number of TIME_WAIT connections.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; machine simply delays the problem but doesn't solve it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, it does not solve the problem, only help it out a little.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At one point in time we happily allocated mbuf after mbuf until the machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ran out of memory and died.  No one complained about all the TIME-WAIT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sessions then :-) Then we put in a max memory threshold which exposed our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inability to create a new session which showed all the TIME-WAIT sessions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which caused us to copy you in reclaiming old sessions rather than waiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the proper 2MSL.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would seem to imply that the system+software combination was not
<BR>
sized properly for the workload at hand and/or the application was
<BR>
flawed. 
<BR>
<P>TCP calls for a 2MSL TIME_WAIT state after connection close (for some
<BR>
not-asymtotic-to-zero value of MSL :). If the system (hardware+software)
<BR>
cannot hold enough TIME_WAIT  states to satisfy that connection rate
<BR>
without undoing part of TCP's correctness algorithms, should it really
<BR>
be operating (or allowed to operate) at that rate? 
<BR>
<P>Lots of ways to go there - raise the bridge (more RAM), lower the river
<BR>
(smaller TIME_WAIT space requirements), or dry-up the river (don't
<BR>
accept more connection until you have a slot for them, or get the
<BR>
multitude of client systems to shoulder the TIME_WAIT burden by
<BR>
rewriting the app).
