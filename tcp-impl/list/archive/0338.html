<P>
(I haven't yet looked over the minutes, being positively buried this week.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         Bob Braden asked what percentage of the attendees are or have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         implementors.  Relatively few of the attendees appeared to be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He asked two very different questions, and got different responses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Who is currently responsible for supporting a TCP implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Who has supported a TCP implementation in the past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question 1 got nil response ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember this differently.  I asked for a show of hands for those who
<BR>
were current maintainers (not sure what phrasing I used), and reported the
<BR>
count as something like 30-35.  (I remember it was a range of n,n+5 and
<BR>
think 30 was the low end - Steve, isn't this in the notes?)  I then asked for
<BR>
who had maintained a TCP in the past but &quot;now knows better&quot;, and that was
<BR>
either 10-15 or 15-20, I think the former.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... Also I wondered if some TCP shops didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send non-responsible ringers to collect info and avoid any contamination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gee, I'd hope that discussing problems in generic terms would mean vendors
<BR>
don't have to resort to these sorts of steps.  (If any list readers want to
<BR>
send me comments about this via private, confidential email, I'll summarize
<BR>
the responses in anonymized form to the list.)
