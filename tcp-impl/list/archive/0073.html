-       A TCP MAY keep its offered receive window closed indefinitely.
<BR>
-       As long as the receiving TCP continues to send acknowledgments in
<BR>
-       response to the probe segments, the sending TCP MUST allow the
<BR>
-       connection to remain open.  (page 92, RFC-1122).
<BR>
- 
<BR>
- However, that this does not imply that the connection MUST be kept
<BR>
- open *indefinitely*.  In this case, it seems that the client not
<BR>
- replying at all causes the server TCP to stay in zero window probing
<BR>
- state forever.  But the server COULD time the connection out, it just
<BR>
- doesn't.  This seems to be a place where the specification needs to be
<BR>
- more concrete.  Maybe it should also say, &quot;If the receiving TCP does
<BR>
- not acknowledge the probes, the sending TCP SHOULD close the
<BR>
- connection.&quot;  Or say &quot;bad things might happen to you if you don't.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Yes.  This bug showed up on our doorstep at Sun, and resolved it this
<BR>
way a couple of years back.  If the receiver doesn't send back an ACK
<BR>
of some kind to the zero window probe, after 8 minutes, we give up.
<BR>
Most TCP's had it, since it was in the BSD base up until at least
<BR>
4.4BSD, if my memory serves.
<BR>
<P>The spec isn't as clear about this as it could be, I think.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
