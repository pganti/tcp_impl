<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Accepting new connections immediately after a quick reboot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be 'breaking' that rule.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Almost every OS that I've ever tested breaks this rule, unfortunately.
</EM><BR>
<P>That rule is not broken if the system cannot be started in less than 2*MSL.
<BR>
Only systems that can do a genuine quick reboot are able to break that
<BR>
rule.  If the system is quiet for 120 seconds after being told to reboot
<BR>
and until the first user process runs, then the system cannot and does
<BR>
not break that rule.
<BR>
<P>Which systems have you tested that break that rule?
<BR>
<P>I can't think of a operating system that I've seen in recent years that
<BR>
could break that rule if it wanted to, because they boot soooo sloooowly.
<BR>
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT Workstation 4.0, IRIX of all versions
<BR>
since it was renamed from &quot;UNIX&quot; in about 1987, all versions of SunOS and
<BR>
Solaris I've seen (albeit none newer ~1994), Linux in Redhat 5.1 and 5.2,
<BR>
NetBSD as of a few years ago, and FreeBSD through 2.2.7 are unable to
<BR>
break that rule unless you insist on the official, full MSL instead of
<BR>
the common BSD short value.  Some of those systems could break that rule
<BR>
even with the full 120 second MSL of RFC 793.  SHEESH!--Some could not
<BR>
break that rule even if the MSL were significantly longer than 120 seconds.
<BR>
