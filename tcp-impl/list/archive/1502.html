&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; As for sending multiple requests in a row, I think the additional
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; idea about SO_EXPLICITPUSH could be used to fix the delay of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; final packet.  I've bounced this idea around before, but never
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; followed through on it.  My suggestion is to just add a MSG_PUSH
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; flag that would be used on the last send to indicate that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; application doesn't intend to send anymore data at this time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; I don't like SO_EXPLICITPUSH, because that means that the kernel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; is trusting the application to remember to tell it when it is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; done sending the data.  If the application forgets, then it could
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; adversly affect the performance below what would have happened
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; had SO_EXPLICITPUSH not been set.  I'd rather have the kernel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; continue to be as aggressive as normal in sending out data, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; take the MSG_PUSH bit as a suggestion that it should be more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; aggessive and transmit any delayed data, since no more data will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; be written at this time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt;

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
<P>Dave,
<BR>
<P>Yes. Your definition of MSG_PUSH seems to exactly match the PUSH bit in
<BR>
the TCP spec (FINALLY!!!!!!!).
