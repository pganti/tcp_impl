<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; The purpose of this implementation detail is already covered verbosely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in RFC-813 (July 1982):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;Measurement of TCP implementations, especially on large operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     systems, indicate that most of the overhead of dealing with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     segment is not in the processing at the TCP or IP level, but simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     in the scheduling of the handler which is required to deal with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     segment.  A steady dribble of acknowledgements causes a high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     overhead in scheduling, with very little to show for it.  This waste
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     is to be avoided if possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;... the receiver of data need not, and for efficiency reasons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     should not, acknowledge the data unless either the acknowledgement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     is intended to produce an increased useable window, is necessary in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     order to prevent retransmission or is being sent as part of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     reverse direction segment being sent for some other reason.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More terse explanations (with cross references) are given in RFC-1122.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here is something from RFC-1122 which talks about actual times:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.3.2  When to Send an ACK Segment
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A host that is receiving a stream of TCP data segments can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase efficiency in both the Internet and the hosts by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending fewer than one ACK segment per data segment received;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is known as a &quot;delayed ACK&quot; [TCP:5].
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A TCP SHOULD implement a delayed ACK, but an ACK should not be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excessively delayed; in particular, the delay MUST be less than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.5 seconds, and in a stream of full-sized segments there SHOULD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be an ACK for at least every second segment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; you are concluding that because the data follows the ACK within a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; second that this is indicative of insufficient delayed ACK.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have to say that this is the first time a stack based on our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; implementation has been accused of *not* delaying ACKs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My text concluded that, since your Ack is immediately followed by your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _own_ application data (no matter how long or short the time), that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either you are not using delayed Ack _or_ the delay is &quot;too short&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Using the 1 second granularity given in your trace, how do you decide
<BR>
how much time passed before the ACK was sent?  Since the upper bound
<BR>
on the delay (as given in RFC-1122) is .5 seconds, if the
<BR>
implementation is using delayed ACKs, the delay will have to be .5 sec
<BR>
or less.  But since your trace granularity is 1 second, you will get a
<BR>
reading of either 0 or 1 second, one of which is too short, one of
<BR>
which is too long.  This could lead you to believe that either:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The implementation doesn't do delayed ACKs, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The implementation uses delayed ACKs, but violates the spec
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which states that the delay should be .5 sec or less.
<BR>
<P>However, you can't be sure of either of these without a finer
<BR>
granularity trace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this case, you now indicate that you have implemented delayed Ack.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Therefore, my evaluation holds that the delay _is_ &quot;too short&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is probably not true.  Again, you need better a granularity trace
<BR>
in order to tell.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you have another explanation?
</EM><BR>
<P>The ACK is indeed delayed, but since it was delayed by less than 1
<BR>
second, you read the delay as 0.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can you provide a trace with a better time resolution?
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you?  It seems like you are the one saying that there's a problem.
<BR>
The burden of proof ought to be on you to try to produce evidence of
<BR>
the problem.  It's not fair for you to say, &quot;X's implementation is
<BR>
broken unless someone from X proves that it's not.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Does the time resolution matter in the face of clear evidence?
</EM><BR>
<P>It sure does.  The evidence is by no means clear without better time
<BR>
resolution on the trace data.
<BR>
