<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:touch@ISI.EDU?Subject=Re:%20TIME-WAIT%20truncation&In-Reply-To=&lt;199706052247.QAA06508@mica.denver.sgi.com&gt;">touch@ISI.EDU</A>

<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Denying the connection attempts&quot; is a poor defense against a denial of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; service attack such as SYN bombing, since causing you to deny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; connection attemptss is the purpose for the SYM bombing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is NO other solution to SYN attacks. SYN attacks serve two purposes:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	- deny other SYN attempts (presumably legitimate)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	- deny service to ongoing (ESTABLISHED) connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is no way to avoid denying access to other SYN attempts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ever purported solution, e.g., authenticating incoming SYNs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; via digests, checking them against incoming lists, etc., have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the additional effect of slowing SYN processing in general, and consuming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CPU resources in general, both of which slow SYN processing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the legitimate requests.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, those were obviously non-solutions when they were proposed last year
<BR>
in netnews groups.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The best you can do is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	1- prevent SYN attacks from consuming large numbers of resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		e.g., partition the TCB space, and limit the percentage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		allocated to SYN_RCVD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	2- prevent SYN attacks from consuming large amounts of CPU resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		e.g., limiting the frequency of processing SYN requests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	3- prevent SYN attacks from affecting ESTABLISHED connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		e.g., via solutions #1 and #2 together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	4- prevent SYN attacks from synchronizing and completely starving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   legitimate incoming SYNs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		e.g., pick randomly from queued incoming SYNs, not 'end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		of queue'
</EM><BR>
<P>There is one more thing you can do, and which the well known and widely
<BR>
implemented and deployed defenses do, and that is continue providing
<BR>
your normal services despite the SYM bombing.  #4 and drop-oldest with
<BR>
big listen queues, like RED in a different universe, is quite effective
<BR>
for that.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; The SYN bombing issue is long over and solved, essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; independently of CERT, and certainly independently of any verifying by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you or ISI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Geez - *US* meant this group. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This mailing list is also long after the fact for solving SYN bombing.
<BR>
<P>As I said, the SYN bombing problem was solved and new releases or
<BR>
patches distributed for major implementations last year or at least
<BR>
last winter.  I've recognized other names of some those directly
<BR>
involved among contributors to this list.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;                               Not me or ISI, though, if the SYN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombing is so over and solved, why is the issue of parititioning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the processing and having to live with slower SYN processing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still misunderstood?
</EM><BR>
<P>Could it be because except superficially, the problems are quite different?
<BR>
What problem doesn't involve partitioning and appropriate scaling?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; The solution to SYN bombing is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     - use as large a listen queue as you can afford, and try to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        the cost of each slot on the listen queue small and searching a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        big queue fast so you can afford more.  At least 30K slots is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        one recommendation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     - drop either the oldest or a random, pre-existing entry in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;        listen queue when it is full and a new SYN arrives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No. The solution is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	- LIMIT the size of the listen queue to some percentage of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		the overall mbuf or TCB space
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean the system shouldn't crash?  Does such a goal really need
<BR>
stating here?
<BR>
<P>In fact, increasing the listen queue from its ridiculously tiny (in
<BR>
1997 if not 1982) size of 10 (or 15) to 100 or 1000 goes a long way to
<BR>
dealing with SYN bombs, as well as various similar side effects of
<BR>
dealing with large streams of HTTP hits.  I think Dave Borman's
<BR>
solution involves a specialized listen queue of 30,000 slots.  Details
<BR>
involve the cryptographic strength of the hash table used for the
<BR>
listen queue (assuming you use a hash table).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 	- I don't know how to drop, but I know that picking randomly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  works, if the queue can hold them - I do know that picking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  the newest one is wrong, since it allows the attacker to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  synchronize with the timeout of the SYN_RCVD states.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be nice if there were archives of the mailing list in which
<BR>
this was hashed out last year.
<BR>
<P><P>As I recall, the relevant parameters for SYN bombing are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L = listen queue length in slots
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R = SYN bombing rate in SYNs/sec
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T = RTT to the most distant legitimate client
<BR>
<P>Interesting and common values of L are 15 (i.e. 10*3/2), 100, 1000, and
<BR>
30,000.  Interesting values of T less than 300 ms for directly
<BR>
connected peers, and up to about 2 seconds for PPP/modems.  Interesting
<BR>
and currently relevant values of R range from 5 (people just tying to
<BR>
be a pain or real dumbies) to 200 (v.34 modem with VJ header
<BR>
compression) to 500 (ISDN) to 5000 as a generally agreed design limit.
<BR>
<P>Drop-oldest-entry in listen queue works fine provided T&lt;L/R when T&gt;L/R.
<BR>
Then drop-random protects with probability ((L-1)/L)**(T*R)
<BR>
<P>I like an explicit combination of drop-oldest with random-drop.
<BR>
Others like a hybrid drop-oldest-within-random-hash-bucket.
