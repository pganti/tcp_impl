<P>
I don't quite follow some of the details here:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It relates to user abort of web page download (more and more frequent as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people follow more interesting links - up to 40% of connections abort,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; according to Vern Paxson's logs at LBL).  The web server blocks on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; write() if there is unacknowledged data in the pipe - there usually is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - and the client does a close.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't quite follow the above. Do you really mean:
<BR>
<P>a) the server blocks on a close() if there is unacknowledged data in
<BR>
the pipe (this would be independent of whether the client has closed
<BR>
its end of the connection)?
<BR>
<P>b) the server blocks on a write() if a send window's worth of data is
<BR>
unacknowledged.
<BR>
<P>c) Some TCP implementations actually block the caller on a write() if
<BR>
there is *any* unacknowledged data in the pipe. (These stacks using
<BR>
stop-and-wait must get really great throughput :-)
<BR>
<P>I don't see the problem with the first two behaviors. I'd argue that
<BR>
the third case is a broken stack on the server, and there is little
<BR>
the client can/should do.
<BR>
<P>At the same time, if the client has &quot;closed&quot; its end of the connection
<BR>
and couldn't care less to receive any more data from the server, then
<BR>
it should do a &quot;half duplex&quot; close as outlined in RFC 1122 which would
<BR>
cause any subsequent traffic from the server to trigger a RST back to
<BR>
the server.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; RFC1122 says that as it is a half duplex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; close and there is unread data, a RST should be sent.  And it is needed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to flush the data and unblock the write - there is a PC stack out there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that doesn't do this, and the server process hangs for ever.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^
<BR>
<P>What exactly does the &quot;this&quot; refer to? After the client has issued a
<BR>
&quot;half-duplex&quot; close, it silently ignores any additional traffic from
<BR>
the server (including retransmissions)? That would be majorly broken
<BR>
(since the &quot;blocked&quot; server will eventually retransmit, which should
<BR>
trigger the RST, preventing the server from hanging/deadlocking).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To get round this, Netscape (but not all web browsers) sets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SO_LINGER to zero, i.e. the application forces the RST.
</EM><BR>
<P>But this would only send out a single RST, which might get lost. What
<BR>
happens if the RST is lost and the server retransmits? Aren't we now
<BR>
back in the same situation described in the first paragraph, which
<BR>
presumably can lead to hung servers too, right?
<BR>
