<P>I have seen a particular failure mode a number of times; while it's
<BR>
not an implementation fault, the failure mode is arcane enough that
<BR>
it has lead to a number of escalations and it would be good to document it.
<BR>
<P>For example, see the following scenario:
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------          ----------
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|           |          |        | 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    |           |   (2)    |        |   (3)
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt;========| ALG/proxy |----------| Router |--------&gt;  ISP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|           |          |        | 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|           |          |        | 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------          ----------
<BR>
<P>(1) is a FDDI ring to a customer's internal network (MTU=4470)
<BR>
(2) is a DMZ existing of a regular ethernet 
<BR>
(3) is a T1 serial link to an ISP.
<BR>
<P>There is a configuration error in this network: the MTU on the
<BR>
serial line of the router is 1500 bytes (default); the ISP's end
<BR>
of the serial line is 4470 bytes. The rest of the path to a remote
<BR>
web server has MTU=4470 all the way, so that packets of this size
<BR>
can be sent by the web server to the ISP end of serial line (3)
<BR>
without being fragmented along the path.
<BR>
<P>Without PMTU discovery, this MTU mismatch would go undetected
<BR>
as the proxy would send a small MSS (1460). Because of this, the web server
<BR>
will send 1460-byte packets which will pass Router without a problem.
<BR>
<P>With PMTU however, the host MUST send a large MSS even over ethernet
<BR>
(so that it can take advantage if a route flap causes the traffic
<BR>
to go over FDDI, we could use FDDI's MTU). So, we'll send MSS=4430
<BR>
and as a result, the web server will send 4470-bytes packets, 
<BR>
which will be sent through the ISP's router onto the serial line.
<BR>
<P>However, because Router's serial interface is configured for MTU=1500,
<BR>
the packet will get dropped because it's oversized. No ICMP error
<BR>
message is sent because Router can't receive the whole packet
<BR>
and hence can't generate an ICMP message.
<BR>
Because no ICMP message is sent, packet retransmissions from the web server
<BR>
will have the same size and will also be silently dropped.
<BR>
<P>This leads to the following scenario:
<BR>
- One is able to ping remote site
<BR>
- When sending a HTTP request (in this example), the TCP handshake
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;happens, one is able to send the HTTP request (and have the request
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;data ACKed by TCP), and then total silence till things time out,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;leading to responses like &quot;the web site doesn't respond&quot;, or worse
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;this problem started with your new release with PMTU discovery,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;so your product has a problem with PMTU discovery&quot;
<BR>
<P>Typically I detect this kind of problem by sending large-size ping
<BR>
packets to the remote end of a suspect link. If the link is misconfigured,
<BR>
then the ICMP echo response won't make it back to us (but it will work
<BR>
for small-size ICMP echo packets). 
<BR>
Traceroute won't be able to detect this because the response packet is 
<BR>
always small.
<BR>
<P>I think that documenting these types of scenarios (which is similar to Matt's)
<BR>
would be very useful. While it's indeed not in the direct scope of 
<BR>
the tcp-IMPL wg, this venue does have the people with the right experience
<BR>
so that a good document can be made.
<BR>
I have done a little testing and found this type of problem more common
<BR>
than I expected, so writing it up would be good.
<BR>
<P>Geert Jan
<BR>
<P>PS: I just saw a note in the is-is WG where they discussed making the
<BR>
HELLO packet max size, just to detect his problem. I'm not sure if
<BR>
putting this kind of test in a routing protocol is a good idea,
<BR>
but having a widespread test would be good.
