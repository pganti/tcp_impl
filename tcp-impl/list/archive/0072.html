<P>
<EM>&gt; 1S. Server is in a write() sending data to the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1C. User hits STOP or something, the application does a close().
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2C. Client aborts and sends either a FIN or RST 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	(lets say a FIN to show the problem, and reasons for RST instead)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3C. The client application has destroyed the socket, and it detached
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  	from the stack for that connection. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	From the client stack side, the connection no longer exists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3S Server continues to be in a write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Server Stack goes to CLOSE_WAIT ( having received the FIN )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4S Server will continue to write to the client, until it has exhausted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    its window. This is OK for a half-close.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5S The window is exhausted, and the server will wait until the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    opens the window. (window probes )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4C. The client should, but doesnt  send a RST upon receiving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	 remaining data from the server or window probes.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the server is sending into what it thinks is an open window, and
<BR>
the client doesn't reply at all (RST or otherwise), then the server
<BR>
would simply time out the connection, right?  However, if the client
<BR>
has already advertised a zero window before the socket was torn down,
<BR>
then the server will be in a zero window probing state in which,
<BR>
according to the spec, it MUST send zero window probes periodically to
<BR>
see if the window has opened.  It must be the case then that the
<BR>
server sends enough data to fill the client window before the client
<BR>
decides to tear down the connection and send the RST, or otherwise it
<BR>
would just kill the connection when the client doesn't respond.  For
<BR>
example, maybe when the 'stop' button is clicked, the client stops
<BR>
reading long enough for a zero window to be advertised before the
<BR>
connection is closed down.  The spec states:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A TCP MAY keep its offered receive window closed indefinitely.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the receiving TCP continues to send acknowledgments in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response to the probe segments, the sending TCP MUST allow the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection to remain open.  (page 92, RFC-1122).
<BR>
<P>However, that this does not imply that the connection MUST be kept
<BR>
open *indefinitely*.  In this case, it seems that the client not
<BR>
replying at all causes the server TCP to stay in zero window probing
<BR>
state forever.  But the server COULD time the connection out, it just
<BR>
doesn't.  This seems to be a place where the specification needs to be
<BR>
more concrete.  Maybe it should also say, &quot;If the receiving TCP does
<BR>
not acknowledge the probes, the sending TCP SHOULD close the
<BR>
connection.&quot;  Or say &quot;bad things might happen to you if you don't.&quot;
<BR>
<P>We have a tool called Orchestra that we have used to test several
<BR>
different vendor TCP implementations by injecting faults (drop, delay
<BR>
messages, fabricate new messages) into the segments sent by the TCP
<BR>
peers.  In one of our tests, we dropped zero window probes to see what
<BR>
participants do.  What we found in most of the TCPs we tested (SunOS,
<BR>
Solaris, AIX, OS/2, Next Mach) was that the TCP did not time out
<BR>
connections that are in the zero window probe state, even if the other
<BR>
TCP does not ACK the probes.  Only one implementation (Windows 95)
<BR>
actually timed out the connection once it was in a zero window probe
<BR>
state if the peer did not ACK the probes.
<BR>
<P>It seems that the Win 95 TCP is doing a good thing by timing out
<BR>
connections whose peer does not ACK zero window probes.  (At least it
<BR>
isn't going against spec.)  If the server platform were Win 95, this
<BR>
&quot;server hanging&quot; condition would not happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, the bad stack implementation is in widespread use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the current versions of it *still* do not fix the problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>But if other TCPs dropped connections that do not ACK zero window
<BR>
probes, this &quot;bad stack&quot; would not affect the server any more than if
<BR>
it refused to ACK data messages.  Even though the client TCP is messed
<BR>
up, the server would simply time out the connection and go on about
<BR>
its business (dying, cleanup, whatever).  Even though we'd want the
<BR>
bad stack to be fixed, it wouldn't be as much of a problem if we were
<BR>
more resilient to the way that it's bad.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sticking up for the 'bad stack'.  I don't even know which
<BR>
stack it is, and definitely think it should be fixed.  I'm saying that
<BR>
just because it's out there doesn't mean that people who run web
<BR>
servers (or OS's that run web servers) are at its mercy.
