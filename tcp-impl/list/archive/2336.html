<EM>&gt;  - in addition to (or even instead of) a static secret that you feed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   MD5, you should use something that even the host cannot know in advance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   such as a fine granularity real time clock.  It's also nice to throw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   into the pot things with at least some bits of entropy such as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   memory addresses of TSP's and buffers containing packets such as the SYN.
</EM><BR>
<P>At least on Linux hashing the addresses of packets in would not help very
<BR>
much: A SYN data payload is &lt;= 64bytes, so it would always end up in the
<BR>
same zone of the zone allocator. For 64byte allocations there are only a few
<BR>
pages in that zone, which are predictable. Brute forcing the possible
<BR>
addresses in the zone is quite possible (only a few thousand candidates) 
<BR>
For the brute force attack you only need the ISN of a single SYN.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On a 10 MHz Ethernet, packets (including the SYN) arrive with milliseconds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of jitter and so more entropy than you can use for the ISN, provided you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a clock that ticks microseconds or better.
</EM><BR>
<P>iirc that was proposed but rejected because it could possible allow an
<BR>
attacker with a sniffer on your local ethernet to maintain a copy of your
<BR>
entropy pool.
