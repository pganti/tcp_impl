<EM>&gt;From Thomas Narten:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 2. Client *stack* doesnt send RSTs to the servers data when its in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 	FIN_WAIT_X
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I actually think this is correct. The FIN_WAIT_x states imply that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;application is still using the socket, waiting for the peer to finish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sending data. If, on the other hand, the application had invoked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'half-duplex close' (and has destroyed the socket), the client TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should go into some state other than FIN_WAIT_x.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think whether a tcp end-point still has a client associated
<BR>
with it has anything to do with what tcp state the connection should
<BR>
be in. The key is to send a RST to break a potential deadlock if data
<BR>
still arrives for any connection whose client has ditched it already.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; client closes with FIN, server ACKs: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; client in FIN-WAIT-2 advertising zero window (which makes a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; of sense since it cannot read any more)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here is where we still seem to be having a disagreement. If the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has &quot;destroyed&quot; the socket and is no longer using the socket, then TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will never be able to deliver additional received data to the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;application. In this scenario, it is wrong for the client TCP to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respond with an ACK and window advertisement of zero,
</EM><BR>
<P>Again a RST and nothing else should be sent whenever data arrives
<BR>
destined to a detached connection.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Ian Heavens:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think the close() call, or the Winsock equivalent, sends a FIN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as normal, unless there is pending data to be read, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case a RST is sent.  If data arrives after the FIN has been sent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a RST is sent (RFC1122).
</EM><BR>
<P>Solaris does the just that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Josh Cohen:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; send FINs, it tells TCP to do so via an API call. I suspect that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mean it issues a 'half-duplex close', which is *supposed* to send RSTs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and cause subsequent received data to trigger a RST.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Umm. I dont think thats right.  A half close does not cause a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;RST to be sent.  Actually, I think that regardless of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;half or full close, what is sent on the wire is the same, a FIN.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;half close is just the time that elapses after the client sends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the FIN and before the server sends its own FIN.
</EM><BR>
<P>It looks like there is still some confusion between half-close and
<BR>
'half-duplex close' here. The former is for a client to tell the other
<BR>
end 'I have no more data to SEND', whereas the latter says
<BR>
'I don't intend to RECEIVE any more data 'cause I'm going away.'
<BR>
Unfortunately, TCP protocol only offers an explicit signal for the
<BR>
former, namely 'FIN'. Therefore RST has to be called upon for the
<BR>
latter when there is any potential risk of deadlock, e.g. data
<BR>
is destined for a detached connection. (Of course the timer should
<BR>
always be able to break a deadlock like this. But it could take a
<BR>
long time...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Mathew Lodge:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;While we're on the subject of vendors... isn't the best way to ensure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good TCP implementations are widely used to explicitly involve the vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of popular OSes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For example, if you could get (say) Microsoft and Sun involved, you'd cover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most of the clients and many of the servers on the Internet. Yes, I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are other popular boxes out there and Bill Gates is beelzebub, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let's face it -- Windows has a huge installed user base and lots of folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are using that Windows TCP/IP stack, and Sun also has a huge installed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;server base.
</EM><BR>
<P>You can rest assured that we (Sun) are very involved :-).
