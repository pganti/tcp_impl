<P>
<EM>&gt; Given you are concerned about Appletalk and PCI, perhaps we just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to agree you are addressing a different performance level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; storage system.  I see no reason for hardware support at Appletalk
</EM><BR>
<P>No we are addressing the same level of performance in a general purpose OS
<BR>
the difference is my case doesn't need weird protocol hacks. When working
<BR>
with a dedicated storage system RDMA becomes even less interesting because
<BR>
you code the stack to the needs of the filer. You don't even need an MMU
<BR>
on such kit
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; proposed NIC if this is really to be taken as a serious alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to an RDMA option.  I for one dont find it a competitive design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (it is also one that was previously considered.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't find RDMA a credible useful solution at the protocol level. It
<BR>
doesn't offer any visible advantage, it complicates the stack futher thus
<BR>
punishing the majority in the interest of the few.
<BR>
<P>I'm interested in why you think such a NIC wouldnt work, Providing you have
<BR>
interrupt mitigation I see no reason for it to fail. I'd be interested
<BR>
to know what the flaws in that technique were in your eyes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; doing this, so I regard this as a done deal.  (I'd hate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be a high-speed NIC vendor that cant do this.)
</EM><BR>
<P>But can you do it at $6 a part in volume ? Thats what the other 99.9% of the
<BR>
people care about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only issue is how to handle the next level of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocols that have high performance requirements, i.e. storage.
</EM><BR>
<P>ST already has this sort of stuff figured out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, NICs with hardware enhancements for protocol support,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as the Intel Gigabit Ethernet NIC have been very successful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both in performance and market.  So, expect more there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Intel provide no useful documentation so that is hard to evaluate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finally, the RDMA option is targeted to allow use of standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Internet protocols for SANs in place of  specialized protocols
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and networks such as  FibreChannel, especially for non-local 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access.
</EM><BR>
<P>So is ST and ST is proven technology. If you are going to break the protocol
<BR>
to add hacks to it you might as well design the protocol properly based on the
<BR>
past twenty years of learning where TCP is hard to get right. You need IP to
<BR>
be compatible you don't need TCP.
<BR>
<P>If you want to solve the generic problem then you don't need RDMA anyway
<BR>
