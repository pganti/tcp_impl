||Your point is taken.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||My point is that very small amounts of available buffer space must
<BR>
||imply very low end-to-end performance.  The practice of advertising
<BR>
||buffering that you don't have should be strongly discouraged.  
<BR>
||
<BR>
||Curtis
<BR>
||
<BR>
||btw- I meant to imply that DOS was broken, not someones software's DOS
<BR>
||TCP stack if that's any consolation.
<BR>
<P>Peace on the word war, but I still feel that theres a point to perhaps
<BR>
be beat into the ground.  Low end, high end machine doesn't matter -
<BR>
a TCP stack in such machine operates in a competive environment against
<BR>
a complex set of marketing points which can cause the TCP stack's behavior
<BR>
to be less optimal than other behavior.
<BR>
<P>In our days of yore, we lost more sales due to:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* memory footprint
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* pure optimal LAN test performance
<BR>
than we did due to TCP's lack of congestion control.  I can perhaps
<BR>
dig through dozens of cases where we had to argue w/ customers that
<BR>
alternative DOS stacks with no slow start and no congestion window,
<BR>
while faster over the LAN were doomed to lose in the real world.  Or
<BR>
that small footprint stacks that whizzed in a PC Week performance test
<BR>
didn't necessarily behave well in a 4 concurrent app across the internet
<BR>
test.  And we also got beat up that a sophisticated user could tune
<BR>
our stack to run fast, but an out of the box config. was not
<BR>
optimally tuned for LAN performance.
<BR>
<P>As the NC's and Wintel NC's start to come out we will revisit those
<BR>
days once again.  &quot;Buying decisions&quot; are made far too often on somewhat
<BR>
meaningless performance benchmarks.
<BR>
<P>But back to your point; had I to do it over again, your absolutely
<BR>
right, I would not have advertised a window greater than the amount of
<BR>
available buffer space and would have had people implement the window
<BR>
shrinking algorithm we talked about but never did.
<BR>
