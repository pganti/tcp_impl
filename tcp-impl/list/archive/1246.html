<P>In BSD at least, keepalives are implemented by sending a TCP segment
<BR>
containing a single byte of &quot;garbage&quot;. However, the SEQ field is one
<BR>
less than the receiver is expecting, so it is not accepted as real data.
<BR>
<P>When the receiver sees an &quot;old&quot; data packet (i.e., a packet containing
<BR>
data that has already been acked, i.e., the sequence number in the
<BR>
header plus the length of its data is less than the receiver's RCV.NXT)
<BR>
it is required by the spec to send a segment with its next expected
<BR>
sequence number, i.e., RCV.NXT, in the ACK field.  (This is primarily
<BR>
intended to prevent deadlock in normal data transfer should an
<BR>
acknowledgment packet be lost.) The &quot;polling&quot; TCP uses this &quot;do-nothing
<BR>
ACK&quot; as the indication that the remote host is still there. So hosts
<BR>
that don't respond properly to BSD-style keepalives are most likely not
<BR>
following the spec.
<BR>
<P>Having said this, I should point out that keepalives are NOT a formal
<BR>
part of the TCP spec. I also think they're a very bad idea.  I didn't
<BR>
always feel this way. However, some long and frustrating experiences
<BR>
with slow, unreliable and often expensive network paths (amateur packet
<BR>
radio, as well as commercial X.25 networks that charge for every packet)
<BR>
have turned me into a crusader against keepalive pinging.  It simply
<BR>
isn't worth the cost, especially when there's no way for me to tell the
<BR>
other end to cease and desist.
<BR>
<P>Besides, the whole philosophy of TCP and the datagram approach to
<BR>
networking was supposed to be reliability and robustness in the face of
<BR>
network problems. Why should the system gratuitously close a connection
<BR>
just because the network path happens to go down for a few minutes? If
<BR>
the connection has been idle during the entire outage, the user wouldn't
<BR>
even know (or care) that there had been a problem, as long as it's back
<BR>
by the time he sends more data. But keepalive pinging will make SURE he
<BR>
knows in the most annoying way possible!
<BR>
<P>In the same category are TCPs that immediately close a connection when they
<BR>
get an ICMP Unreachable message. At most they should abort connections
<BR>
only before they are established; once established they should serve as
<BR>
diagnostic messages only.

<P>When TCP was first designed, and for all subsequent versions, it was
<BR>
thought inappropriate to impose any kind of semantics on the logical
<BR>
connections extablished by TCP. In particular, no sense of absolute
<BR>
timeout for the severing of a connection was desired. We thought that
<BR>
such notions of &quot;impatience&quot; or &quot;time to give up&quot; ought to be the
<BR>
choice of the upper level protocol using TCP as the basis merely for
<BR>
reliable delivery.
<BR>
<P>A part of this view stemmed from the fact that the networks over which
<BR>
TCP had to function, for the DoD applications we had in mind, were
<BR>
potentially very unpredictable as to loss and delay. Mobile packet
<BR>
radio systems had to function under jamming and radio shadow effects,
<BR>
for instance. TCP never unilaterally severed connections but only
<BR>
reported failure to achieve positive acknowledgement after a time
<BR>
which could be controlled by the application or upper-level protocol.
<BR>
It was up to the application to decide whether to sever the connection
<BR>
and, even then, the choice to do so gracefully or abruptly was also
<BR>
left to the application.
<BR>
<P>The use of a feature (X-level NOP) to test the liveness of a TCP
<BR>
connection is consonant with the model against which the TCP was
<BR>
designed.

<P>I can detect loss of connectivity real easily.  Just type a character.
<BR>
If the connection won't work, it will time out, or get an immediate
<BR>
TCP reset. 
<BR>
<P>However, I have no desire to watch my Telnet windows just go *pop*
<BR>
just because there was a lack of connectivity for thirty seconds.
<BR>
This happens quite often in the real world, like when one route goes
<BR>
away, and the routing protocols have to re-settle.  In the interim,
<BR>
the keepalives will cause ICMP error messages to be sent (which
<BR>
routers *must* send to meet RFC 1009), and the connection will be
<BR>
gratuitously shot.
<BR>
<P>Keep-alives are, from my point of view, keep-deads.  They guaruntee
<BR>
that the my connection *will die* any time there is any momentary
<BR>
network outage.  Keep-alives are absolutely contrary to the robustness
<BR>
principle.  (See TCP RFC.)
<BR>
<P>In my experience, keep-alives kill far more live connections than dead
<BR>
ones. 
<BR>
<P>If we're going to retain the stupid idea of keep-alives, lets add a
<BR>
session protocol to TCP-IP to put the connection back together after
<BR>
the keep-alive kills it.  However, since I doubt many people want to
<BR>
add a session protocol to TCP, I'd rather kill keep-alives.
<BR>
<P>Let's quit trying to bend over backwards to make the TCP/IP specs
<BR>
match the 4.xBSD implementations.  They were experimental, and not
<BR>
fully conformant to the specs.  They were optimized for a local
<BR>
network, not an Internet.  The specs work, lets meet them.  Fix the
<BR>
code.
<BR>
<P><P>If you want the server Telnet host to be able to clean up your
<BR>
connection, many systems have inactivity timers, which can kill it for
<BR>
you.  Please don't break our TCP protocol because of a limitation in
<BR>
some other operating system.

<P>Sorry, I can't let this go by without commenting on Phil's message
<BR>
and this discussion, even though the discussion has mostly died down.
<BR>
(I haven't been reading tcp-ip very often, but noticed this subject
<BR>
line going by.)
<BR>
<P>Last time Phil and I talked about keepalives in person, I asked him
<BR>
whether he had problems with telnet/rlogin servers accumulating on
<BR>
his systems if they didn't use keepalives.  We certainly accumulate
<BR>
junk, including xterm programs, waiting for input from a half-open
<BR>
connection.  Phil told me that he doesn't have problems, because
<BR>
he runs a &quot;wall&quot; every night to force output to all users, and of
<BR>
course breaking connections that time out.  In other words, Phil
<BR>
violently objects to servers requesting keepalives from TCP, but
<BR>
allows the system manager (himself) to force them above the application
<BR>
level.  And before people jump up to point out the difference in time
<BR>
scales, the current BSD code sends no keepalive packets until a connection
<BR>
has been idle for 2 hr, and that interval is easily changeable.
<BR>
One proposal for the Host Requirements document was to wait for 12 hr.
<BR>
I think that's a bit high, but the difference is only a factor of 6.
<BR>
Compare the number of keepalive packets with the number of packets
<BR>
exchanged by an xterm and an X server over the course of a week
<BR>
if used 4 hours a day!
<BR>
<P>Phil says:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I'd go a little further, though,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and say that a REMOTE USER (not just the application code) must always
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be able to turn off keepalives, even on binary-only systems. It does no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good to say &quot;the application must be able to disable keepalives&quot; when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm having problems with a remote server that I have no administrative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control over.
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry, Phil, but remote users have no more right to override system
<BR>
management policies than do local users (at least on *our* systems!).
<BR>
On some of the systems where I have guest accounts, local or remote
<BR>
users are logged off if they aren't active for two hours.  I don't like
<BR>
that, either, but I don't claim that the managers of those systems
<BR>
have no right to enforce such a policy.

<P>Steve,
<BR>
<P>Let me try, one last time:
<BR>
<P>If the application can direct TCP as to the periodicity and the action
<BR>
to be taken (notify application vs. abort connection) then the application
<BR>
will not abort your connection unless the application programmer decided
<BR>
to force that condition.  Under proper design, the programmer will give the
<BR>
user a switch to set, indicating something about the &quot;persistance&quot; that
<BR>
is desired.
<BR>
<P>With respect to having the mechanism in tcp or the application, I agree with
<BR>
you, philosophically, that the mechanism should be in the application (although
<BR>
I believe the OSI model would put it into the session layer, but that seems
<BR>
mostly to be part of the application process, these days.
<BR>
<P>The major issues, however, are kernel vs. user space, and additional
<BR>
complexity to the application protocol.
<BR>
<P>There is a remarkable economy that derives from puting this mechanism
<BR>
into the kernel/transport system.  It may be an accident that TCP does
<BR>
not have the mechanism but can be tricked into creating one, but it still
<BR>
is remarkably simple.
<BR>
<P>Most application protocols have very simple interaction styles and tend to
<BR>
be relatively easy to program.  To force time-based generation of action
<BR>
would complexify these protocols significantly.

<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am losing a keep-alive war with a customer who wants me to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implement keep-alive in our tcp implementation (SNS/TCPaccess for MVS).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is about the statement in Host Requirements RFC1122, section
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.3.6, which says &quot;This interval MUST be configurable and MUST default
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to no less than two hours&quot;.  Does this suggest the idle interval may NOT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be configured to less than two hours?  Do you have some other suggestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a minimum idle interval?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred

<P>Fred,
<BR>
<P>I can only say, keep up the Good Fight!  No, it's OK to allow a customer
<BR>
to configure it to 10 seconds if he wants to!  It's just that the
<BR>
software &quot;out of the box&quot; must have a default of at least 2 hours.  If
<BR>
a customer wants to set it smaller, presumably he will not then complain
<BR>
to the world about a TCP reliablity problem, having caused the problem
<BR>
himself.   Well, maybe rational behavior is too much to hope for...
<BR>
