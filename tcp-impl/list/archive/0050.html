There was a discussion a while back on the end2end-interest list about
<BR>
the behaviour of HTTP clients on PC systems, why they generate RSTs
<BR>
and whether it is the application or the stack that does this.  I talked
<BR>
to Josh Cohen at Netscape who enlightened me, so I post it here as it
<BR>
has implications for the WG. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It relates to user abort of web page download (more and more frequent as
<BR>
people follow more interesting links - up to 40% of connections abort,
<BR>
according to Vern Paxson's logs at LBL).  The web server blocks on a
<BR>
write() if there is unacknowledged data in the pipe - there usually is
<BR>
- and the client does a close.  RFC1122 says that as it is a half duplex
<BR>
close and there is unread data, a RST should be sent.  And it is needed
<BR>
to flush the data and unblock the write - there is a PC stack out there
<BR>
that doesn't do this, and the server process hangs for ever.  To get
<BR>
round this, Netscape (but not all web browsers) sets SO_LINGER to zero,
<BR>
i.e. the application forces the RST.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This is a workaround for a TCP/IP stack problem.  I think there are two
<BR>
conclusions here:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
1.  It is important (VERY!) for TCP/IP stacks to follow RFC1122 half duplex
<BR>
close, and there are some that don't.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
2.  RFC1122 half duplex close is a MUST rather than a SHOULD.  The above
<BR>
example implies that with current applications using a blocking I/O model,
<BR>
unread data on close easily leads to deadlock unless the data is flushed.
