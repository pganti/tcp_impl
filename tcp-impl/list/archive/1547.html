<P>
<EM>&gt; One, i don't think application writers can always guarantee that even if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the write buffer size, all the data will be exempt from Nagle.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, in the BSD stack at least, if you pass too much data for the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (congestion or whatever) window in your send() call, subsequent packets may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject to Nagle (thus susceptible to bad interactions with delayed ACKs at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the remote side).  Check out, for example, John Heideman's article in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; April, 1997, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review, or Henrik Nielsen, et
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; al, from SIGCOMM 1997, for example of fairly well-crafted applications that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still run afoul of Nagle/delayed ACK interactions.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, so one of the problems reported was (IMO) a bug in Apache (sending
<BR>
the headers separate from the data and yes, prompted by a browser bug
<BR>
:), so I'm not sure that is not a priori cause to modify TCP.
<BR>
<P>The second biggie there - the small last segment is at least in part
<BR>
solved by applying nagle on a per-send basis. That does indeed leave-out
<BR>
the case where an application with 4097 bytes of data sends it as 4096
<BR>
+1, and that last &quot;1&quot; gets delayed because it was a separate send. I'm
<BR>
still not sure that is not an application bug for not presenting the
<BR>
4097 bytes of data in a writev() or the like.
<BR>
<P>Where that magic constant changes I do not know, and I can see that as
<BR>
an argument for some explicit flush mechanism between the app and TCP -
<BR>
ioctl or send() flag I suppose. I think though that an application aught
<BR>
to be able to present up to SO_SNDBUF bytes of a &gt; SO_SNDBUF bytes
<BR>
request or response. 
<BR>
<P>Regardless, it is hard for me to not believe that the experiements in
<BR>
the paper were not simply conducted with buggy implementations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Two, i think that making this change may have the effect of preventing people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from wholesale disabling of Nagle.
</EM><BR>
<P>People are already wholesale disabling Nagle, the only question is
<BR>
whether or not we can reverse that trend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I also think i'm happy to have the change apply to &quot;send()s&quot;, as is quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often current practice, rather than to the output of TCP.  I think, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it should be *written* as if it applies to the output of TCP, just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RFC896.)
</EM><BR>
<P>If the updated RFC is written as if it applies to the the output of TCP,
<BR>
there will be someone who really wants to pick nits with implementations
<BR>
that are still doing the right/sufficient thing, just not implementing
<BR>
it precisely the same way. That of concerns me.
<BR>
<P>Also, I'm not sure what part of RFC896 is stating that the algorithm
<BR>
should be impemented on a per-segment basis rather than per-send. For
<BR>
example, the second paragraph of the second &quot;The solution to the small
<BR>
packet problem&quot; reads:
<BR>
<P>#begin quote
<BR>
The solution is to inhibit the sending of new TCP  segments  when
<BR>
new  outgoing  data  arrives  from  the  user  if  any previously
<BR>
transmitted data on the connection remains unacknowledged.   This
<BR>
inhibition  is  to be unconditional; no timers, tests for size of
<BR>
data received, or other conditions are required.   Implementation
<BR>
typically requires one or two lines inside a TCP program.
<BR>
#end quote
<BR>
<P>Notice how it says &quot;new data arrives from the user&quot; - that sounds much
<BR>
more like someone calling &quot;send()&quot; than TCP sending a segment. Two
<BR>
paragraphs later it reads:
<BR>
<P>#begin quote
<BR>
When a user process writes to a TCP connection, TCP receives some
<BR>
data.   It  may  hold  that data for future sending or may send a
<BR>
packet immediately.  If it refrains from  sending  now,  it  will
<BR>
typically send the data later when an incoming packet arrives and
<BR>
changes the state of the system.  The state changes in one of two
<BR>
...
<BR>
Thus, when we omit sending data on arrival from the
<BR>
user,  we  are  simply  deferring its transmission until the next
<BR>
message arrives from the distant host. 
<BR>
#end quote
<BR>
<P>again &quot;a user process writes to a TCP connection&quot; and &quot;when we omit
<BR>
sending data on arrival from the user&quot; sounds like a call to &quot;send()&quot; 
<BR>
<P>if I then switch to RFC1122, I find this in 4.2.2.14 I find:
<BR>
<P>#begin quote
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important TCP performance issue is that some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications, especially remote login to character-at-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a-time hosts, tend to send streams of one-octet data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segments.  To avoid deadlocks, every TCP SEND call from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such applications must be &quot;pushed&quot;, either explicitly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the application or else implicitly by TCP.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result may be a stream of TCP segments that contain one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data octet each, which makes very inefficient use of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Internet and contributes to Internet congestion.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nagle Algorithm described in Section 4.2.3.4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides a simple and effective solution to this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem.  It does have the effect of clumping
<BR>
#end quote
<BR>
<P>with the bit about &quot;every TCP SEND call from such applications...&quot;
<BR>
wouldn't that be the send() socket call? That is the call the
<BR>
application makes. And it says that each send should be &quot;pushed&quot; modulo
<BR>
4.2.3.4 so:
<BR>
<P>#begin quote
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.3.4  When to Send Data
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A TCP MUST include a SWS avoidance algorithm in the sender.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A TCP SHOULD implement the Nagle Algorithm [TCP:9] to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coalesce short segments.  However, there MUST be a way for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an application to disable the Nagle algorithm on an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual connection.  In all cases, sending data is also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to the limitation imposed by the Slow Start
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm (Section 4.2.2.15).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCUSSION:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nagle algorithm is generally as follows:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is unacknowledged data (i.e., SND.NXT &gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SND.UNA), then the sending TCP buffers all user

&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data (regardless of the PSH bit), until the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outstanding data has been acknowledged or until
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the TCP can send a full-sized segment (Eff.snd.MSS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bytes; see Section 4.2.2.6).
<BR>
#end quote
<BR>
<P>So, one might interpret the &quot;regardless of the PSH&quot; bit as being counter
<BR>
to the &quot;interpret on each send()&quot; that I am espousing, but 1122 was
<BR>
expanding upon 896 anyway (since 896 was an unconditional wait, not tied
<BR>
to MSS) so I would argue that interpreting per-send is either a return
<BR>
to (the possible) intent of 896 (it talked of user sends, not tcp_output
<BR>
calls) or simply a further refinement of 1122 (I'm sure there is more
<BR>
chapter and verse out there...). 
<BR>
<P>Short of an explicit end of message indicator, or an explicit flush from
<BR>
the user, the send() boundary is the best bet TCP has for guessing if
<BR>
there is going to be any more data to even be able to make-up an
<BR>
MSS-sized segment in a request/response situation. 
<BR>
<P>We are already (or aught to be) telling apps writers that bigger sends
<BR>
are better. The bigger the sends become, the more Nagle+delACK becomes a
<BR>
race condition or less of a concern yes? 
<BR>
<P>Similarly for a per-send interpretation of Nagle on a bulk-data
<BR>
application - if the application gets ahead of the cwnd (how often does
<BR>
a bulk-data app remain behind cwnd anyway?) cwnd is going to do the
<BR>
aggregating for us anyway. 
<BR>
<P>Make SO_SNDBUF just a skosh larger (perhaps simply as a matter of when
<BR>
one decides it is full...) than the TCP window and you get the same
<BR>
thing when you do stay ahead of cwnd - for instance, HP-UX TCP's from
<BR>
HP-UX 9 up through 10.20 allow a full MCLBYTES to be queued to the
<BR>
socket even if there is only 1 byte left. Fewer icky, small mbuf issues
<BR>
then, and it gives you a better shot of buffering up data in bulk
<BR>
transfers and not having small segments.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure which is easier to implement or the most logical (I have an
<BR>
opinion on the latter :) - per-send or tracking that sndnxt-snduna is
<BR>
not an MSS multiple. It sounds like many stacks have already gone
<BR>
per-send. That (and the proposed change) still leaves all those &quot;series
<BR>
of sub-mss send&quot; apps wanting to disable Nagle, and I'm betting they are
<BR>
the ones we really need to get &quot;fixed&quot; - which is only going to be fixed
<BR>
with the explicit flush. (I do believe that explicit flush appears
<BR>
easier to implement than CORK...)
<BR>
<P>It is interesting (at least to me) to consider what the packets would
<BR>
look like had HTTP been implemented on top of UDP - packet generation
<BR>
would have been on a per-send basis as well...and we would probably be
<BR>
encouraging the http apps types to be presenting as much data to the
<BR>
transport at one time as possible and using writev() and such to avoid
<BR>
long series of sub-MTU-sized datagrams...
