<P>
Thank you for posting to our FFA Pages. This is a one-time
<BR>
mailing; this list will be deleted upon its completion.
<BR>
<P>Greetings!!
<BR>
<P>Today, it's a documented fact that most Americans do not
<BR>
have enough savings for their retirement. Have you been at
<BR>
Wal-Mart recently? What have you seen there? I have seen
<BR>
a number of retirement-aged people working. Some have
<BR>
chosen to maintain an active lifestyle. But, most of them
<BR>
are working simply because they don't have enough
<BR>
retirement income!!!! How sad is that?
<BR>
<P>The Social security system was established to assure that
<BR>
people could retire with ample financial means. However, we
<BR>
can't expect that social security retirement benefits will
<BR>
be adequate when we reach retirement age. In fact, today,
<BR>
it takes 3-4 people to support one retirement benefit.

<BR>
<P>For most people in the private sector, a 401(k) is pretty
<BR>
much the only option to accumulate their retirement needs.
<BR>
<P>A 401(k) is based on investing YOUR OWN funds with your
<BR>
employer matching them. But, they're not as secure as we
<BR>
might hope for.
<BR>
<P>For example: Many employees at Enron, the giant energy
<BR>
trading company, chose to put their 401(k) fund into
<BR>
Enron's stock. However, as the accounting scandal
<BR>
revealed, Enron collapsed within WEEKS, not months, and
<BR>
their 401(k) funds became worthless.
<BR>
<P>Another example: US West was a local telephone company
<BR>
with a good retirement plan. But, after Qwest
<BR>
International acquired US West, their stock value declined
<BR>
to an almost worthless level, and is Now a serious concern
<BR>
for the retirees of US West.
<BR>
<P>This is the reality of the retirement picture RIGHT NOW.
<BR>
<P>WE MUST SECURE OUR RETIREMENT FOR OURSELVES!
<BR>

<BR>
<P>For this reason alone, CASH Evolution is a remarkable
<BR>
opportunity. But, there are many other reasons that make
<BR>
this the most attractive new program ever devised!
<BR>
<P>[1] The monthly fee is ONLY $25 a month, the price of a
<BR>
family pizza.
<BR>
<P>[2] You ONLY need three! With just 3 referrals your
<BR>
membership fee is self-funding. And, these need not be
<BR>
'Personal' referrals! You get credit for them even if they
<BR>
are &quot;Spilled&quot; down to you from your upline.
<BR>
<P>[3] Realistically earn $1,500 a month RESIDUAL income
<BR>
after your 3rd level, of this 5X5 &quot;FORCED&quot; matrix, is
<BR>
filled. Three levels consists of only 160 people,
<BR>
including the sign-ups by your downlines AND 'spillover'
<BR>
from your uplines.
<BR>
<P>(Internet Marketing Giant Mark Joyner, our upline Sponsor
<BR>
and owner of Aesop, Roibot, StartBlaze, and many other Huge
<BR>
Corporations, has just taken on CASHevolution as his pet
<BR>
project and is expected to recruit Hundreds of Thousands of
<BR>
new members to be spilled into our downlines.)
<BR>
<P>[4] The ability to earn up to $9,000 a month RESIDUAL
<BR>
income.
<BR>
<P>[5] 100% payout of membership fees! CASHevolution pays
<BR>
100% of it's membership fees back to it's members through
<BR>
the five levels of this 5X5 FORCED matrix.
<BR>
<P>[6] Paid-out is more than paid-in. Not only do they pay
<BR>
back 100% of the membership fees, 10% of the commissions
<BR>
from levels 3-5 are reinvested in mutual funds, stocks,
<BR>
bonds,etc. So, in essence, what you have here is a self
<BR>
funding 401(k)!!!
<BR>
<P>[7] Free Offshore Account even if you cancel your
<BR>
membership! It costs hundreds of dollars to open an
<BR>
offshore account, with lots of research time to find one
<BR>
you can trust. CASHevolution banks with a UK controlled
<BR>
Bank located in the West Indies and is FDIC Insured. This
<BR>
Bank Account comes with your Membership!
<BR>
<P>[8] And...Much much more
<BR>
<P>The More I've been associated with CASHevolution, the more
<BR>
I have been impressed with their ingenious ideas.
<BR>
<P>They've actually come up with a foolproof opportunity to
<BR>
help those of us who would normally not be able to afford
<BR>
it, to fund an investment portfolio and build a secure
<BR>
future for ourselves and our families.
<BR>
<P>A concept of &quot;Helping Ourselves by Helping Others.&quot;
