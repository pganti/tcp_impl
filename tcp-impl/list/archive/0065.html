<P><EM>&gt; &gt; All this does is (unreliably) kludge around a bug in the transport
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stack. There is no guarantee that RST will ever make it to the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (witness all the connections that get waylaid in FIN_WAIT_2...) And
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, but its a much greater chance than zero, which is what happens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you need to modify the client, might as well modify it correctly.
<BR>
No sense in adding a kludge to get around a bug in your own stack. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If the server's stack is not dropping the connection to RTX exhaustion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that is a bug in the server stack. If it is indeed dropping the
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No.  It the client window is full, the window probes will continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forever.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but if the server sends a TCP segment to the client, the client
<BR>
should send a RST. If the client is returning an ACK with a window of
<BR>
0, that is clearly not right (if it is the case that the client
<BR>
application has &quot;destroyed&quot; the socket and is no longer reading data).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think this statement is true:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There will be no retransmit.  There cant be a retransmit if the window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is closed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think the above has meaning. Whether the server TCP is
<BR>
retransmitting a data segment, or sending a probe, the effect should
<BR>
be the same. The client either returns a RST, or an ACK saying what
<BR>
the current window size is. The apparent bug is (which needs to be
<BR>
verified via a packet trace) that the client is not sending back the
<BR>
correct response.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated, page 325:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The characteristic of the persist state that is different from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retransmission timout in Chapter 21 is that TCP 'never' gives up sending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window probes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless, of course, the peer returns a RST. Also, this assumes that the
<BR>
peer continues to return ACKs saying the window is still 0. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I need to check if the bad stack is responding, at all, to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probes, and to find out: what happens to TCP if the probes are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply unacknowledged?
</EM><BR>
<P>If no ACK are returned, the sender should timeout the connection the
<BR>
same way as it does when retransmitting data.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, this is a tough issue.  if a connection is to be aborted, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only way to have the server discard data it wants to send, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way appears to be via RST.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that this actually has a happy resolution. We probably all
<BR>
agree that RST needs to be sent. We're just disagreeing as to the
<BR>
precise conditions. I'm arguing that the TCP spec already handles this
<BR>
case, and the client stack is (currently) doing the wrong thing. You
<BR>
are suggesting a modification to the client stack to kludge around the
<BR>
the symptoms of the problem.
