<BR>
<EM>&gt;In regards to both queries, you seem to have missed that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussions are all in the sections on delayed Ack.  So, why did they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discuss holding time, RTT, inter-packet arrival time?  All are applied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to delayed Ack.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is in the section on delayed ACK, but in that section it
<BR>
is located in the discussion that starts out:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will assume that sender of the data uses the optional  algorithm
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described  in  the  TCP  specification,  in which the roundtrip delay is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measured using an exponential decay smoothing algorithm.  Retransmission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a segment occurs if the measured delay for that segment  exceeds  the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoothed  average  by  some  factor.  To see how retransmission might be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triggered, one must consider the pattern  of  segment  arrivals  at  the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiver.
<BR>
<P>The remainder of the section goes on to discuss the conditions under which
<BR>
a retransmission is triggered. This discusses how the RTO is computed
<BR>
on the sender side, and what factors should be taken into account,
<BR>
on the sender side, so that the RTO is not to short, this includes
<BR>
taking into account how much the receiver delays the ACK and what
<BR>
the holding time is. This discussion extends until the end of the
<BR>
section.
<BR>
<P>Packet interarrival time is discussed somewhat earlier in that section:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This algorithm will insure that the timer, although set, is  seldom
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used.    The  interval  of  the  timer is related to the expected inter-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segment delay, which is in turn a function  of  the  particular  network
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through  which  the  data  is  flowing.    For the Arpanet, a reasonable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interval seems to be 200 to 300 milliseconds.  Appendix A  describes  an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adaptive algorithm for measuring this delay.
<BR>
<P>I can find no support in the RFC for placing a lower bound on the timeout,
<BR>
beyond the discussion that notes that we prefer it if the timeout for
<BR>
a delayed ack never gets fired. On the other hand, we should also not
<BR>
delay an ack excessively, since that can cause an unnecessary retransmission
<BR>
by the sender. I'll come back to this below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Note that you on a pure receiving link you have no RTT measure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If you use the initial srtt and mdev settings on your link you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; essentially setting the ATO to a constant on a pure receiver.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes (yielding the ceiling value), and the problem is?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll address this below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And &quot;pure receiver&quot; happens in which protocol?  TCP always provides at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least one round trip estimate.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not always true. If you have to retransmit your SYN packet you will
<BR>
have no valid estimate (unless you are using timestamps). Also, if the
<BR>
function describing your transmission time is dominated by
<BR>
the length of the packet you are sending (for example if you are
<BR>
sending over a PPP link), then even if you do get a valid RTT measure
<BR>
on your SYN handshake it will be much lower than the actual RTT on the
<BR>
link. On a link with an MTU of 1500 this will be out by a factor
<BR>
of around 37. This is less of an issue of you are using low granularity
<BR>
timers, but I think it would be wise to avoid setting any new
<BR>
requirements that assume that timers only have a resolution of 500 ms.
<BR>
Now, at this point one might be tempted to argue that this supports placing
<BR>
a lower bound on the ATO (Ack Timeout), say of 100ms. I think this is
<BR>
a mistake.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Remember, it is always OK to have a larger value, as that is the intent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-- the timer should rarely be used, other events should happen sooner.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the timer will never get used, don't bother setting it. The reality
<BR>
is that the timer will get fired, and in fact there are circumstances
<BR>
in which we want it to get fired.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All these strategies are to find an acceptable _lower_ bound for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interactive traffic.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree, I feel there is no acceptable lower bound. I have two
<BR>
reasons.
<BR>
<P>First, delaying ACK's distorts the RTT calculation on the
<BR>
sender side. If the delay is less than the granularity with which
<BR>
the sender measures RTT, then the distortion is minimal, although
<BR>
we can still get some distortion when a delay causes the RTT
<BR>
measure to increase by 1. If the delay is larger than the
<BR>
granularity with which the sender measures the RTT, the distortion
<BR>
is more significant. This leads to an inflated estimate of the RTT
<BR>
on the sender. On a very high speed network this can be many times
<BR>
larger than the real round trip time, leading to long fallow periods (relative
<BR>
to the speed of the transmission medium) during which we are
<BR>
simply waiting for a retransmission timeout to occur.
<BR>
<P>Second, any time we actually fire the delayed ack timer, due to a
<BR>
pause in the stream of packets in the sender, the sooner we fire it,
<BR>
the better. This is because if we wait to long to fire it, the sender
<BR>
might conclude that a packet has been lost, and it should now resend,
<BR>
when in fact no packet has been lost. The problem is worse if
<BR>
you happen to loose some of the ACKs preceeding the one you are currently
<BR>
delaying. Again, this is mostly a non issue if you happen to measure RTT
<BR>
with a granularity of 500 ms. In that case you never retransmit before 500 ms.
<BR>
If the ATO happens to hit the ceiling of 500 ms then you will still get this
<BR>
spurious retransmission, but not otherwise. Note that this problem will
<BR>
almost never happen if you fix the ATO to 200 ms as done in BSD (it can
<BR>
only happen if some preceeding ACKs got lost).
<BR>
