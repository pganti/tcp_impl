The following mail seems to indicate that NCR's MP-RAS
<BR>
Unix was having similar problem after they made changes
<BR>
to the Precedence bits handling in tcp input to conform to
<BR>
RFC 793. They did this change to pass one of the Unix'95
<BR>
Certification test. Now i think they got rid of this change
<BR>
(available in a later patch) - or giving the user an option
<BR>
to turn off/on this behaviour.

<P><EM>&gt; Subject: TOS and PRECEDENCE bits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From: Bob Walpole &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bob.walpole@columbiasc.ncr.com?Subject=Re:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;37E24DA7.318ADAF3@austin.ibm.com&gt;">bob.walpole@columbiasc.ncr.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Date: 1998/12/23
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Newsgroups: comp.protocols.tcp-ip
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's a specific scenario I have ran into a couple of times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By default our TOS field is set to 0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most applications that set the TOS do not set the PRECEDENCE bits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway, at least in my limited experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is IP allowed to tell TCP to reset the connection if the incoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precedence bits do not match those stored in the inpcb for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What should it do, if anything?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this specified anywhere?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have seen precedence bits 110 (when the other interface was X.25) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100 (when the other interface was unkown) in packets from routers. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes the TCP connection to be reset.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Iset ip_settos to 0, would it be reasonable to assume I do not wish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to check the value in the incoming packets?

<EM>&gt; &gt;       5.  6 months later it's discvered that the redefinition causes one

<EM>&gt; &gt;           TCP to send resets.  The email describing this says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; As it turns out, this is an archaically (sp) known

<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; problem, with a pre-existing patch.

<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt;           and elicits a reply:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; MacTCP is *old*, and has many more problems than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; this.  Please tell your help desks that if they run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; across users still using MacTCP, that they advise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; them to upgrade to at least MacOS 7.5.3 (preferably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; 7.5.5), which is free, and includes Open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;                 &gt; Transport.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See also the note this morning from someone reporting about what sounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the same problem with some Windows TCP code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If only ancient MacTCP had the problem, you might, but only might get away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with declaring old MacTCP non-conformant.   That is basically what you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are proposing, to break an unknown number of existing implementations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;       6.  The question now is how many significant TCPs are actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;           effected, and, accordingly, how to fix the problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, on general grounds the fait accompli argument is completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inadmissable.  400 people participating in DiffServ meetings are not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of the IETF, even if majorities mattered, which they don't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if you accept the history as you have stated it (which I don't quite),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the onus for bearing fixing the problem lies with DiffServe, *NOT* TCP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If a painless change can be made to TCP, then that would be great, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would remove the burden from DiffServ.  If there is no painless TCP fix,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then the pain *MUST* be borne by DiffServ.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] That's the point of Last Call - if you care about where the IETF is going,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] you are supposed to read <A HREF="mailto:ietf-announce@ietf.org?Subject=Re:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;37E24DA7.318ADAF3@austin.ibm.com&gt;">ietf-announce@ietf.org</A> and see what is being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] proposed.  You don't have to read all the documents, just the ones that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] appear relevant.  The abstract of RFC 2474 is clear that the document is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] about redefining the TOS byte.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is mistaken in several ways.  Even if the Last Call had said something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about breaking existing TCP, the onus would still be on DiffServ.  However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given the established IETF culture and expectations, something that talks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about redefining the TOS byte would be assumed by knowledgable people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upward compatiable and not break existing installations without explicitly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying so, and not without a lot more main IETF list discussion than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the last call.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By concidence, I had been trying to understand RFC 2474 before all of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broke, and had assumed the intent of RFC 2474 was to be upward compatible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The words in RFC 2474 are not entirely clear, but they do promise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant upward compatibility.  Consider the start of section 4:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The DS field will have a limited backwards compatibility with current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   practice, as described in this section.  Backwards compatibility is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   addressed in two ways.  First, there are per-hop behaviors that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   already in widespread use (e.g., those satisfying the IPv4 Precedence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   queueing requirements specified in [RFC1812]), and we wish to permit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   their continued use in DS-compliant nodes. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; Since getting anything changed during Last Call is at best difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] The WG raised the issue of what depends on the current structure of the TOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] byte at length, had considerable discussion, and no one brought up the TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] incompatibility.  It's not as though it wasn't high profile - 400+ people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] attend each diffserv meeting.  But even so, it was on the radar as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] significant issue, and I think it would have been treated very seriously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] as a last call comment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am confident of the good intentions of all concerned.  Still, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; balancing painful changes, which sub-community (or if you prefer, chunks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of code) must suffer most of the pain?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; Instead of requiring changes to an unknown but apparently significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; number of existing TCP implementations and literally uncountable TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; installations, why not strengthen the DiffServ words about upward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; compatibility?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] One of the key questions is: is it really a significant number of TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] implementations?  That's why this discussion should happen on tcp-impl.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that is a critical question.   The note this morning about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows 3.1 was extremely worrisome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; If the RFC 1349/RFC 1812 values of the IP TOS byte were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; required to be get through unchanged (after possibly having been mapped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; to other values and back again), would any existing combinations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; applications and host break?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] How do you know what to map them back to?  It's not a one-to-one mapping.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which map is not 1:1 and does it matter?  Since RFC 2474 defines a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more potential behaviors than RFC 1812 and RFCX 1349, you obviously cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; map DiffServ 1:1 onto RFC 1349.  However, in practice there are only about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3 different RFC 1349 values.  It seems to me that requiring that DiffServ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserve 3 values would completely would be painless for DiffServ, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far wiser than declaring that an unknowable number of TCP implementations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and installations non-conformant and requiring them to be changed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the only commonly used RFC 1349 values are 0 (extremely common),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0x10 (minimize delay), and 0x80 (maximize throughput).  See your nearest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BSD source trees.  I found all of those in the first 4.4BSD-Lite CDROM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I know that 0x10 has been creeping into other widely used applications,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partly because I've helped push it.
