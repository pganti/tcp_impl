<EM>&gt; As you indicate, the choices for reacting to a retransmitted packet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is itself dropped include the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1) waiting for a retransmit timeout;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (2) re-retransmitting one packet and slow-starting;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (3) re-retransmitting dropped packets and sending new packets, subject 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to cutting the congestion window in half for each window of data in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   which one or more packets are dropped, and subject to the constraint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the outgoing packets need to be clocked by incoming dup acks.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know which of these three is best for the network, in a
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If you do anything but 3, the backoff can be dramatic enough that
<BR>
there is a period of link underutilization with FIFO and drop tail.
<BR>
<P>The idea of TCP (IMHO) is to maximize goodput without being so
<BR>
aggressive as to risk congestion collapse and without causing
<BR>
excessive delay.  (Where excessive is any more delay than is needed to
<BR>
keep the link full - note that delay is a secondary consideration.)
<BR>
<P>If you lower delay or delay variation you go to SFQ and use only your
<BR>
fair share (not using TCP) or go with WFQ, CBQ, or some other more
<BR>
sophisticated than FIFO scheme and make a reservation and use more
<BR>
than you fair share.
<BR>
<P>This doesn't mean that 1) or 2) is wrong, it just that it is currently
<BR>
thought that it won't yield quite as high aggregate goodputs.
<BR>
<P>This would probably be a moot point if RED were widely deployed and
<BR>
drops were spaced out by more than an RTT rather than bunched.  In
<BR>
that case 3) just gets hosts past that messy time when routers don't
<BR>
behave quite as well as we'd like them to despite our best efforts at
<BR>
arm twisting the router (and rack modem, terminal server, etc) vendors.
