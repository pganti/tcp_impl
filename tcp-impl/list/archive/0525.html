<EM>&gt; &gt; I disagree. The approach outlined by Vern and essentially in use in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BSDI has very wide support and should be implemented by most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vendors. The SYN cookie approach is at very best (I'll be very very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; charitable here) experimental.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have failed to provide reasons, logic or justification.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't re-done flame wars done elsewhere, yes. I'm not that
<BR>
interested in them.
<BR>
<P>Here, though, is a starter: the TCP sequence number etc. isn't big
<BR>
enough to provide enough space to encode port/source info and all the
<BR>
rest of the TCP state you need, let alone encode them AND provide
<BR>
enough room for cryptographic authentication. Too much of the space is
<BR>
meaningful -- would be recognised by a host as &quot;valid&quot;. Writing a
<BR>
program to burn a machine running SYN cookie code to the floor doesn't
<BR>
look particularly hard. It is, in fact, far worse, since I can induce
<BR>
fake state on many hosts that WILL NOT GO AWAY -- the machines will
<BR>
think that a SYN-SYNACK exchange has happened after just getting a
<BR>
single packet. Do a little creative guessing, and you can tie the
<BR>
machine in knots -- worse knots than you could tie it in without SYN
<BR>
cookies. Given this, why bother with the exercise? The whole thing
<BR>
protects NOTHING.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;cookie&quot; idea was not invented by Dan. It was invented by me and
<BR>
several other people on a private mailing list formed immediately
<BR>
after the SYN flood thing first appeared. We rejected our own idea --
<BR>
as well as variations on the theme like PING state probes -- because
<BR>
they DON'T WORK. Dan came along, re-invented it, and has gotten lots
<BR>
of people to adopt the concept.
<BR>
<P>I mean, I really loved my ping state probe idea. It was simple and
<BR>
elegant, and just plain won't work on a real internet where things
<BR>
filter ICMP.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think you have a leg to stand on in any such argument other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than as proof that all should be documented.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whatever, Alan. I must admit that I haven't done much on this topic
<BR>
because I frankly don't care about the security of Linux boxes and
<BR>
they are the only ones adopting this thing. Call me callous, but after
<BR>
flames I got in the past trying to point out problems to linux types I
<BR>
just decided &quot;let 'em burn -- doesn't hurt me or my clients&quot;.
<BR>
<P>However, that doesn't mean its going to get into an RFC.
