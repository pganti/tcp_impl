<P>
Are we arriving at the conclusion/concensus that the problem being
<BR>
solved here (that a single send of say 1.5MSS bytes encounters a delay
<BR>
in the second segment) has already been dealt with in a number of
<BR>
production TCP stacks by interpreting Nagle on a &quot;send&quot; rather than a
<BR>
&quot;segment&quot; basis? And that a pair of 0.75 MSS sends would still encounter
<BR>
the &quot;son of Nagle&quot; interaction?
<BR>
<P>rick jones
<BR>
<P>PS where can I find the original &quot;chapter and verse&quot; on Nagle?
<BR>
<P>PPS - As this thread continues, I've been in contact with one person who
<BR>
inherited an application that disable Nagle, but did not know why, nor
<BR>
what the Nagle algorithm was. So, as part of &quot;outreach&quot; :) I wnt through
<BR>
the 30 second descrition of what it did and how buggy applications might
<BR>
interact with it and the ACK policies - he seems very pleased to learn
<BR>
what was going on and thought he could remove the call. Is that perhaps
<BR>
the root problem here - that people are writing apps without
<BR>
understanding? 
<BR>
<P>I'm guessing that with the possible exception of a very small number of
<BR>
applications (small, streaming transactions?), the disabling of Nagle is
<BR>
really just a kludge, and that the networks as a whole would be best-off
<BR>
if we got the applications fixed? If they were going to adopt the
<BR>
secondary flush proposal in the RFC there would need to be app changes
<BR>
anyway... so we are talking about doing outreach with the apps types
<BR>
either way.
