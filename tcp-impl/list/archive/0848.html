<P>
Marooned on a desert island so to speak I found myself w./ broken code
<BR>
to incrementally update a TCP checksum and no reference code to check
<BR>
against. The last time I debugged a TCP checksum bug was at least 8
<BR>
years back.  I still remembered the theory, but found that the details
<BR>
excluded me.  What did I checksum, the header, header and data, header
<BR>
and data and something else?
<BR>
Off I went to the RFC's, many of them in fact.  RFC793 explains what
<BR>
to checksum and does so reasonably clearly.  RFC 1122 says you *must*
<BR>
compute a checksum.  RFC1071 has great math on the checksum, has good
<BR>
source code on how to do a checksum and mentions incremental update,
<BR>
but does not have source code.  RFC1141  has theory and math as to how
<BR>
to implement the incremental update. RFC 1624 is more theory and math
<BR>
about incremental update of the checksum and supplants RFC1141.
<BR>
<P>then there is RFC1631 (Network address translator) which mentions
<BR>
incremental update and provides source code for an incremental update
<BR>
that almost works.  Not to mention RFC1936 which is a wonderfully
<BR>
detailed explaination (with logic code included!) of how to implement
<BR>
a checksum in hardware.
<BR>
<P>What a confusing mess.  And I know my way around many of the issues of
<BR>
checksum and know where to look and what to believe I think..).
<BR>
<P>It seems to me, having experienced this first hand; that it would be a
<BR>
good thing to draw all the checksum issues together into a single
<BR>
implementation note which indicates who and what to believe.
<BR>
<P>In terms of clarity I'd like to see a source code example added for
<BR>
incremental update which supercedes the broken source in RFC 1631.
<BR>
<P>L.
