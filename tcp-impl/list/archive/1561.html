<P>
<EM>&gt; In the case you are doing Nagle on send() (rather than on segments leaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tcp_output()), then the send(904) would *not* be delayed by the modified Nagle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithm.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I'm losted then :) Or perhaps I missed a clarification:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Nagle algorithm modifies this as follows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a TCP has less than a full-sized packet to transmit,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if any previous less than full-sized packet has not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet been acknowledged, do not transmit a packet.
<BR>
<P>So, the application doing internal buffering in 4096 byte chunks trying
<BR>
to send 5000 bytes goes
<BR>
<P>send(4096) - this is &gt; MSS so it all goes out right away
<BR>
&nbsp;xmit 1460
<BR>
&nbsp;xmit 1460
<BR>
&nbsp;xmit 1176
<BR>
send(904)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
the second send call is &lt; MSS, and there is an unacked, less than
<BR>
full-sized segment on the network, so the send(904) waits.
<BR>
<P>Is the clarification I'm missing that in essence _all_ instances of
<BR>
&quot;packet&quot; were replaced by &quot;send?&quot; If a TCP is presented with less than
<BR>
an MSS-sized send to transmit, and if any previous less than MSS-sized
<BR>
send has not been acknowledged, do not transmit the send. Is that it?
<BR>
<P>I've been assuming something a triffle simpler (presumeably) to
<BR>
implement - if the send is larger than MSS send all of it now (windows
<BR>
willing). If the send is less than MSS, only send it if it and unsent
<BR>
data combines to form a &gt;=MSS-sized segment.
<BR>
<P>Which have you been assuming?
<BR>
<P>rick
<BR>
<P>PS - since everyone in the discussion is on the mailing list, might as
<BR>
well trim the reply to just tcp-impl - that will serialize the
<BR>
discussion through the list server, and cut-down on the number of
<BR>
messages some of us receive :)
