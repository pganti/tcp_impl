<P><EM>&gt; This is the syn_cooky solusion. I believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vernon's random_drop solusion super-set this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one. Does anyone have info about the radom_drop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solusion ?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think the syn-cooky solution was different, and neither a super-set,
<BR>
sub-set, extension, or precursor of random-drop.  I also don't like it.
<BR>
<P><P>Exactly what is the question?
<BR>
<P>Dave Borman's solution can be viewed as a superset of random drop.  He
<BR>
switched to a hash table to find TCB's, something that everyone who deals
<BR>
with large numbers of sockets must do to avoid performance problems.  He
<BR>
also changed things so that much less state is kept for each partly open
<BR>
connection.  When that table overflowed, he picked an arbitrary,
<BR>
reasonably random connection to throw out of the table.  That last bit
<BR>
of picking a random connection to give up on instead of either the classic 
<BR>
4.*BSD tactic of the newest connection or other systems' giving up on
<BR>
the oldest connection is crux of random-drop.
<BR>
<P>Note that the idea of random-drop was suggested by a public note by
<BR>
Robert Morris Jr.
<BR>
<P><P>Has something happened to BSDI?  Is there any reason to think that their
<BR>
FTP site won't be back?  I can't reach them either, but it looks more like
<BR>
a routing problem at about the nearest default free router from here
<BR>
than a corporate dissolution.
