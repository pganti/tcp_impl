<EM>&gt; Its actually non trivial because no write is always big enough. You also get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interactions with stuff like sendfile. HP seem to have done a send this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data then the file type thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>When we implemented sendfile(), we made sure that the amalgam (?) of the
<BR>
header data specified by the application and the file data arrived at
<BR>
TCP in a way that made it behaves as if it was one &quot;send&quot; call so there
<BR>
were no Nagle/delayed ACK interactions. 
<BR>
<P>(Not to say that we didn't experience that in some early protos of
<BR>
course :)
