<P>
So, How in the heck have you been?
<BR>
<P>Do you remember holding previous conversations regarding business and
<BR>
money making opportunities? I did not send this to you in error!
<BR>
<P>You Said:
<BR>
<P>If only I could find an easier way to make a higher income!
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>If I had more money, I could spend more time with my Family, and less
<BR>
time at work and I sure could use more money so I could pay off my
<BR>
bills once and for all!
<BR>
<P>And
<BR>
<P>I would love to get involved in a business in which will generate money
<BR>
while I am not at work (like a Gas Pump)!
<BR>
<P>Dear Friend,
<BR>
<P>There is a possibility that we haven’t met, but you were chosen by
<BR>
someone to receive this E-Mail. Please, please, print this off and
<BR>
read thoroughly. Be sure that you don’t miss any of the points
<BR>
outlined.  Then put it down, and then read it again. I am sending
<BR>
you a whole lot of information in which you might not understand
<BR>
the first time you read it. If you don’t believe this  program
<BR>
will work for you, send it to 10-20 of your closest friends
<BR>
(in which you trust deeply),  and ask them what they think?
<BR>
This really works! Have faith, don’t miss this opportunity,
<BR>
get involved also, and it will work for you as it does for us!!!!
<BR>
<P>Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, A Major Nightly
<BR>
News Program recently dedicated an entire show to the investigation of
<BR>
the
<BR>
program described below to see if it really can make people money.
<BR>
The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their
<BR>
findings proved that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the
<BR>
participation in the program. This has helped to show people that this
<BR>
is a simple, harmless and fun way to make extra money at home. The
<BR>
results have been truly remarkable. So many people are participating
<BR>
that those involved are doing much better than ever before. Since
<BR>
everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting.
<BR>
<P>You will understand only if you get involved!

<BR>
<P>Hello, My name is Johnathon Rourke, I’m from Rhode Island.  The enclosed
<BR>
<P>information is something I almost let slip through my fingers.
<BR>
Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought
<BR>
and study to it. Two years ago, the corporation I worked for the past
<BR>
twelve yearsdown-sized and my position was eliminated. After
<BR>
unproductive
<BR>
job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year,I
<BR>
incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends
<BR>
and
<BR>
creditors over$35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and
<BR>
I
<BR>
just could not seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow
<BR>
against
<BR>
my home to support my family and struggling business.
<BR>
<P>AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life. I am writing
<BR>
to share the experience I hopes that this could change your life
<BR>
FOREVER.
<BR>
FINANCIALLY$$$!!!
<BR>
<P>In mid December, I received this program in my e-mail. Six months prior
<BR>
to
<BR>
receiving this program I had been sending away for information on
<BR>
various
<BR>
business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my
<BR>
opinion,were
<BR>
not cost effective. They were either toodifficult for me to comprehend
<BR>
or
<BR>
the initial investment was too muchfor me to risk to see if they would
<BR>
work.
<BR>
But as I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program.I
<BR>
didn’t
<BR>
send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list.
<BR>
<P>THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!
<BR>
<P>After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly.
<BR>
I
<BR>
couldn’t believe my eyes! Here was a MONEY MAKING MACHINE I could start
<BR>
immediately without any debt. Like most of you I was still a little
<BR>
skeptical and a little worried about the legalaspects of it all. So I
<BR>
checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24-hrs)  and
<BR>
they
<BR>
confirmed that it is indeed legal ! After determining the program was
<BR>
LEGAL
<BR>
I decided WHY NOT!?!??
<BR>
<P>Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time
<BR>
on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don’t need any paper for
<BR>
<P>printing to send out the program, and because I also send the product
<BR>
(reports) by e-mail, my only expense is my time. In less than one week,I
<BR>
was
<BR>
starting to receive orders for REPORT #1.
<BR>
<P>By January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to
<BR>
RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU DON’T
<BR>
SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. My first step in making $50,000 in
<BR>
90
<BR>
days was done. By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.
<BR>
Your
<BR>
goal is to RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN
<BR>
2 WEEKS. IF NOT SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU! DO. ONCE YOU HAVE
<BR>
100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL.
<BR>
<P>Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2. 96 more than I needed. So I
<BR>
sat back and relaxed.
<BR>
<P>By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, received $58,000 with more coming
<BR>
in
<BR>
every day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much need new car!
<BR>
Please
<BR>
take your time to read this plan, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER$!!!
<BR>
Remember, it won’t work if you don’t try it. This program does work, But
<BR>
you
<BR>
must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your
<BR>
<P>name in a different place. It won’t work and you’ll lose out on a lot of
<BR>
<P>money! In order for this program to work, you must meet your goal of 20+
<BR>
<P>orders for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make
<BR>
$50,000 or more in 90 days.
<BR>
<P>I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!
<BR>
<P>If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really
<BR>
is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If you choose
<BR>
toparticipate, follow the program and you will be on your way to
<BR>
financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and
<BR>
are financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own
<BR>
business, consider this a sign. I DID! $$
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Johnathon Rourke
<BR>
<P>A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you
<BR>
have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded
<BR>
that
<BR>
such a program, and one that is legal, cpuld not have been created by an
<BR>
<P>amateur. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable
<BR>
business
<BR>
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing
<BR>
the
<BR>
same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn’t
<BR>
working.
<BR>
Finally, I figured it out. It wasn’t me, it was the economy. Inflation
<BR>
and
<BR>
recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since
<BR>
1945.
<BR>
I don’t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because
<BR>
many
<BR>
of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and
<BR>
bankruptcies than ever before. The middle class was vanishing. Those who
<BR>
<P>knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did
<BR>
not,
<BR>
including those who never had anything to save or invest, were moving
<BR>
down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, THE RICH GET RICHER
<BR>
<P>ANDTHE POOR GET POORER.  The traditional methods of making money will
<BR>
never
<BR>
allow you to move up or get rich, inflation will see to that You have
<BR>
just
<BR>
received the rest of  your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
<BR>
EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few months than you have
<BR>
everimagined.I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this
<BR>
<P>money, nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.
<BR>
I
<BR>
retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of
<BR>
programs.
<BR>
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way.
<BR>
It
<BR>
works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copyof this
<BR>
exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send
<BR>
<P>this to may send out 50,000 and your name will be on everyone of them!
<BR>
REMEMBER though, ------ the MORE YOU SEND OUT, the more potential
<BR>
customers
<BR>
you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas,  information,
<BR>
materials and opportunity to become financially independent.
<BR>
<P>IT IS UP TO YOU!! NOW DO IT!!
<BR>
<P>BEFORE YOU delete this program from your in box, as I almost did, take a
<BR>
<P>little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and
<BR>
figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst
<BR>
possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still
<BR>
make a
<BR>
lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts
<BR>
you
<BR>
have will vanish when your first orders come in. $$$ IT WORKS!!! $$$
<BR>
<P>Jody Jacobs Richmond, VA.
<BR>
<P>HERE’S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF
<BR>
DOLLARS$$$$!!!!
<BR>
<P>This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure
<BR>
that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you
<BR>
say
<BR>
BULL, please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter,but
<BR>
a
<BR>
perfectly legal money making business. As with all multi-level
<BR>
businesses,
<BR>
we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our
<BR>
products.
<BR>
Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business
<BR>
partners, and we sell and deliver a product for EVERY dollar received.
<BR>
<P>YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not
<BR>
involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home,
<BR>
store or
<BR>
office. This is the EASIEST marketing plan anywhere! It is simply order
<BR>
filling by e-mail! The product is informational and instructional
<BR>
material,
<BR>
keys to the secrets for everyone on how to open the doors to the magic
<BR>
world
<BR>
of E-COMMERCE, the information highway, the wave of the future !
<BR>
<P>PLAN SUMMARY:
<BR>
<P>(1) You order the 4 reports listed below ($5 each) They come to you by
<BR>
e-mail.
<BR>
<P>(2)  Save a copy of this entire letter and put your name after Report #1
<BR>
and
<BR>
move the other names down.
<BR>
<P>(3)  Via the internet, access Yahoo.com or any of the other major search
<BR>
<P>engines to locate hundreds of bulk e-mail service companies (search for
<BR>
bulk
<BR>
email) and have them send 25,000  50,000 emails for you about $49+.
<BR>
<P>(4)  Orders will come to you by postal mail simply e-mail them the
<BR>
Report they ordered. Let me ask you  isn’t this about as easy as it
<BR>
gets?
<BR>
<P>By the way there are over 50 MILLION e-mail address with millions more
<BR>
joining the internet each year so don’t worry about running out or
<BR>
saturation. People are used to seeing and hearing the same
<BR>
advertisements every day on radio/TV. How many times have you received
<BR>
the same pizza flyers on your door? Then one day you are hungry for
<BR>
pizza
<BR>
and order one. Same thing with this letter. I received this letter many
<BR>
times  then one day I decided it was time to try it.
<BR>
<P>YOU CAN START TODAY UST DO THESE EASY STEPS: STEP #1 ORDER THE FOUR
<BR>
REPORTS
<BR>
<P>Order the four reports shown on the list below (you can’t sell them if
<BR>
you don’t order them).  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp;
<BR>
NUMBER
<BR>
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &amp;
<BR>
RETURN
<BR>
ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose name appears on the
<BR>
list
<BR>
next to the report.MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN
<BR>
CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! Within a few days you will receive, by e-mail
<BR>
<P>each of the four reports.Save them on your computer so you can send them
<BR>
to
<BR>
the 1,000’s of people who will  order them from you.
<BR>
<P>STEP #2. ADD YOUR MAILING ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER
<BR>
<P>a. Look below for the listing of the four reports.
<BR>
b. After you’ve ordered the four reports, delete the name and address
<BR>
under REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle.
<BR>
c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.
<BR>
d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.
<BR>
e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.
<BR>
f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure
<BR>
you
<BR>
<P>COPY ALL INFORMATION, every name and address, ACCURATELY!
<BR>
<P>STEP #3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
<BR>
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to these instructions. Now
<BR>
you
<BR>
are ready to use this entire e-mail to send by e-mail to prospects.
<BR>
<P>Report #1 will tell you how to download bulk email software and email
<BR>
address so you can send it out to thousands of people while you sleep!
<BR>
Remember that 50,000+ new people are joining the internet every month!
<BR>
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can
<BR>
<P>afford $20 and initial bulk mailing cost). You obviously already have a
<BR>
computer and an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE! There are two
<BR>
primary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK
<BR>
E-MAIL
<BR>
let’s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and
<BR>
we’ll
<BR>
assume you and all those involved email out only 2,000 programs each.
<BR>
Let’s
<BR>
also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. The response
<BR>
could be
<BR>
much better. Also, many people will email out thousands of thousands of
<BR>
programs instead of 2,000 (Why stop at 2000?) But continuing with this
<BR>
example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is
<BR>
<P>only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out
<BR>
2,000
<BR>
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
<BR>
respond
<BR>
and order REPORT #2.Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total
<BR>
of
<BR>
200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those
<BR>
1,000 send out 2,000  programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
<BR>
response
<BR>
to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4. That’s 10,000 $5 bills for you.
<BR>
CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5000 +
<BR>
$50,000
<BR>
for a total of $55,550!!!
<BR>
<P>REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL
<BR>
TO
<BR>
WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A
<BR>
MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS
<BR>
INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!
<BR>
<P>METHOD #2 PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the internet
<BR>
is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to
<BR>
advertise. Let’s say you decide to start small to see how well it works.
<BR>
<P>Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first
<BR>
level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a
<BR>
larger
<BR>
response). Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets only
<BR>
10
<BR>
downline members. Look how this small number accumulates to achieve the
<BR>
STAGGERING results below:
<BR>
<P>1St level  your first 10 send you $5........................$50
<BR>
2nd level  10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)............$500
<BR>
3rd level  10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)......$5,000
<BR>
4th level 10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)..$50,000
<BR>
$$$$$$ THIS TOTALS
<BR>
------------------------------------------------55,5550
<BR>
$$$$$
<BR>
<P>AMAZING ISN’T IT Remember friends, this assumes that the people who
<BR>
participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would
<BR>
happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100’s of
<BR>
participants and many will continue to work this program, sending out
<BR>
programs WITH YOUR NAME ON THEM for years! THINK ABOUT IT!
<BR>
People are going to get emails about this plan from you or somebody else
<BR>
and
<BR>
many will work this plan  the question is Don’t you want your name to be
<BR>
on
<BR>
the emails they will send out?
<BR>
<P>*** DON’T MISS OUT !!!***
<BR>
***JUST TRY IT ONCE !!!***
<BR>
***SEE WHAT HAPPENS !!!***
<BR>
***YOU'LL BE AMAZED !!!***
<BR>
<P>ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that
<BR>
the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt
<BR>
<P>because they can’t advertise until they receive the report!
<BR>
<P>GET STARTED TODAY: PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THE FOUR REPORTS NOW. Note:--
<BR>
ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
<BR>
ACCEPTED.
<BR>
Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in two sheets of paper.
<BR>
On
<BR>
one of those sheets write:
<BR>
<P>(a) the number &amp; name of the report you are ordering
<BR>
(b) your e-mail address, and
<BR>
(c) your name &amp; postal address.

<P>*************TIPS FOR SUCCESS***************
<BR>
TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the
<BR>
directions accurately.  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you
<BR>
will have them when the orders start coming in because: When you
<BR>
receive a $5 order you MUST send out the requested product/report.
<BR>
It is required for this to be a legal business and they need the
<BR>
reports to send out their letter (with your name on them).
<BR>
<P>--ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. Be
<BR>
patient and persistent with this program- If you follow the
<BR>
instructions exactly results WILL FOLLOW. $$$$
<BR>
<P>************ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ***************
<BR>
<P>Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: If you don’t receive
<BR>
20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or
<BR>
sending
<BR>
e-mail until you do. Then a couple of weeks later you should receive at
<BR>
least 100 orders for REPORT #2. If you don’t continue advertising or
<BR>
sending
<BR>
e-mail until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for
<BR>
REPORT
<BR>
