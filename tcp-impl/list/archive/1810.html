<EM>&gt; From: Vern Paxson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vern@ee.lbl.gov?Subject=Re:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;199909151933.NAA25200@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">vern@ee.lbl.gov</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	5.  6 months later it's discvered that the redefinition causes one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    TCP to send resets.  The email describing this says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; As it turns out, this is an archaically (sp) known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; problem, with a pre-existing patch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    and elicits a reply:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; MacTCP is *old*, and has many more problems than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; this.  Please tell your help desks that if they run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; across users still using MacTCP, that they advise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; them to upgrade to at least MacOS 7.5.3 (preferably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; 7.5.5), which is free, and includes Open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		  &gt; Transport.
</EM><BR>
<P>See also the note this morning from someone reporting about what sounds
<BR>
like the same problem with some Windows TCP code.
<BR>
<P>If only ancient MacTCP had the problem, you might, but only might get away
<BR>
with declaring old MacTCP non-conformant.   That is basically what you
<BR>
are proposing, to break an unknown number of existing implementations and
<BR>
installations.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 	6.  The question now is how many significant TCPs are actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    effected, and, accordingly, how to fix the problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.
<BR>
<P>However, on general grounds the fait accompli argument is completely
<BR>
inadmissable.  400 people participating in DiffServ meetings are not a
<BR>
majority of the IETF, even if majorities mattered, which they don't. 
<BR>
Even if you accept the history as you have stated it (which I don't quite),
<BR>
the onus for bearing fixing the problem lies with DiffServe, *NOT* TCP.
<BR>
If a painless change can be made to TCP, then that would be great, and
<BR>
would remove the burden from DiffServ.  If there is no painless TCP fix,
<BR>
then the pain *MUST* be borne by DiffServ.

<BR>
<P>] That's the point of Last Call - if you care about where the IETF is going,
<BR>
] you are supposed to read <A HREF="mailto:ietf-announce@ietf.org?Subject=Re:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;199909151933.NAA25200@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">ietf-announce@ietf.org</A> and see what is being
<BR>
] proposed.  You don't have to read all the documents, just the ones that
<BR>
] appear relevant.  The abstract of RFC 2474 is clear that the document is
<BR>
] about redefining the TOS byte.
<BR>
<P>That is mistaken in several ways.  Even if the Last Call had said something
<BR>
about breaking existing TCP, the onus would still be on DiffServ.  However,
<BR>
given the established IETF culture and expectations, something that talks
<BR>
about redefining the TOS byte would be assumed by knowledgable people to
<BR>
upward compatiable and not break existing installations without explicitly
<BR>
saying so, and not without a lot more main IETF list discussion than
<BR>
the last call.
<BR>
<P>By concidence, I had been trying to understand RFC 2474 before all of this
<BR>
broke, and had assumed the intent of RFC 2474 was to be upward compatible.
<BR>
The words in RFC 2474 are not entirely clear, but they do promise
<BR>
significant upward compatibility.  Consider the start of section 4:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The DS field will have a limited backwards compatibility with current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;practice, as described in this section.  Backwards compatibility is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;addressed in two ways.  First, there are per-hop behaviors that are 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;already in widespread use (e.g., those satisfying the IPv4 Precedence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;queueing requirements specified in [RFC1812]), and we wish to permit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their continued use in DS-compliant nodes. ...
<BR>
<P><P>] &gt; Since getting anything changed during Last Call is at best difficult
<BR>
]
<BR>
] The WG raised the issue of what depends on the current structure of the TOS
<BR>
] byte at length, had considerable discussion, and no one brought up the TCP
<BR>
] incompatibility.  It's not as though it wasn't high profile - 400+ people
<BR>
] attend each diffserv meeting.  But even so, it was on the radar as a
<BR>
] significant issue, and I think it would have been treated very seriously
<BR>
] as a last call comment.
<BR>
<P>I am confident of the good intentions of all concerned.  Still, when
<BR>
balancing painful changes, which sub-community (or if you prefer, chunks
<BR>
of code) must suffer most of the pain?
<BR>
<P><P>] &gt; Instead of requiring changes to an unknown but apparently significant
<BR>
] &gt; number of existing TCP implementations and literally uncountable TCP
<BR>
] &gt; installations, why not strengthen the DiffServ words about upward
<BR>
] &gt; compatibility?
<BR>
]
<BR>
] One of the key questions is: is it really a significant number of TCP
<BR>
] implementations?  That's why this discussion should happen on tcp-impl.
<BR>
<P>I agree that is a critical question.   The note this morning about
<BR>
Windows 3.1 was extremely worrisome.
<BR>
<P><P>] &gt; If the RFC 1349/RFC 1812 values of the IP TOS byte were
<BR>
] &gt; required to be get through unchanged (after possibly having been mapped
<BR>
] &gt; to other values and back again), would any existing combinations of
<BR>
] &gt; applications and host break?
<BR>
]
<BR>
] How do you know what to map them back to?  It's not a one-to-one mapping.
<BR>
<P>Which map is not 1:1 and does it matter?  Since RFC 2474 defines a lot
<BR>
more potential behaviors than RFC 1812 and RFCX 1349, you obviously cannot
<BR>
map DiffServ 1:1 onto RFC 1349.  However, in practice there are only about
<BR>
3 different RFC 1349 values.  It seems to me that requiring that DiffServ
<BR>
preserve 3 values would completely would be painless for DiffServ, and
<BR>
far wiser than declaring that an unknowable number of TCP implementations
<BR>
and installations non-conformant and requiring them to be changed.
<BR>
<P>I think the only commonly used RFC 1349 values are 0 (extremely common),
<BR>
0x10 (minimize delay), and 0x80 (maximize throughput).  See your nearest
<BR>
BSD source trees.  I found all of those in the first 4.4BSD-Lite CDROM,
<BR>
and I know that 0x10 has been creeping into other widely used applications,
<BR>
partly because I've helped push it.
