<P>
Perhaps an FTP/SMTP/... like response format would be useful - &lt;n&gt; digit
<BR>
code followed by a delimiter (space) followed by human readable text. That
<BR>
way, TCP itself and/or application can decode the numeric code and
<BR>
understand it and the application could also display the returned message
<BR>
for the human to read.
<BR>
<P>It would be interesting for Apple, Sun (Solaris), and/or Mentat to perhaps
<BR>
provide a list of the messages that they currently return so we get an
<BR>
understanding of what the possible reasons they've captured are?
<BR>
<P>Some that I could think of are:
<BR>
- No listener (for a SYN segment)
<BR>
- Unknown connection
<BR>
- Receiver discard connection (data received on a connection with no higher
<BR>
level receiver available)
<BR>
- Application abort (application requested RST on connection instead of
<BR>
closing it)

<EM>&gt; That would be the doubletree in Edinburgh?

<P>Pittsburgh:-).  I inadvertently scheduled it for 11.15 tomorrow when

the morning IETF sessions continue to 11.30.  So 11.30 is fine to meet.

<EM>&gt; Here's my contribution to the discussion:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that the fact that a RST can carry data is a built-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanism for extending TCP.  In my proposal for tcp connections with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparently migrating ends, the data portion of the RST is where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found to stick the additional information, since the &quot;reserved bits&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are apparently untouchable, although they would be good too.  (they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are reserved for the army or something, right, in case they need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nationalize sprintlink all of a sudden for some reason, no?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Excuse me for not having read your proposal - could you post a reference?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I would be against declaring a STANDARD on what that data can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be (Apple apparently includes the reset reason in ascii english) unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the standard still leaves some room for extension.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there must be room for &quot;Vendor Extensions&quot;, whatever standardisation
<BR>
is agreed, so that your application will continue to work.  It's interesting
<BR>
to see this RST data field being used in this way...
<BR>
<P>Apple, Solaris and any Mentat TCP based stack do already include the
<BR>
reason for RST as an ASCII string.  This is valuable in that
<BR>
interoperability
<BR>
issues have been ironed out already. 
<BR>
