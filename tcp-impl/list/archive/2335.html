<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't agree that MD5 hashes of secrets are always required....not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that he says that, but that's what the test authors tell their customers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are much easier ways to attack the ISN computation in most OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyways than attacking MD5:  you attack the secret generation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On diskless devices you can usually just find out the initial secret because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, if the bad guy knows what you're feeding MD5 or SHA, then using them
<BR>
is a waste of CPU cycles.
<BR>
<P>That's why I think
<BR>
&nbsp;- the products that claim to detect predictable ISN's are snake oil and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;frauds, because they have both false positives and false negatives.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- in addition to (or even instead of) a static secret that you feed to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;MD5, you should use something that even the host cannot know in advance,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;such as a fine granularity real time clock.  It's also nice to throw
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;into the pot things with at least some bits of entropy such as the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;memory addresses of TSP's and buffers containing packets such as the SYN.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As soon as you can guess the entropy pool you can guess the secret and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacking the ISN is trivial.
</EM><BR>
<P>and so the trick is to find sufficient entropy with which to generate
<BR>
the ISN.
<BR>
<P>On a 10 MHz Ethernet, packets (including the SYN) arrive with milliseconds
<BR>
of jitter and so more entropy than you can use for the ISN, provided you
<BR>
have a clock that ticks microseconds or better.
<BR>
<P>You still need MD5 to meet the checklists.  MD5 is handy and now fast
<BR>
enough for mixing whatever you have, including configured secrets, entropy
<BR>
from disk spindles, clocks, and buffer addresses.
