<P>
Yesterday I found a serious performance problem that may occur when
<BR>
connecting a client on a box running HP-UX 10.20 to a server running
<BR>
NT 4.0 (w/service pack 3 installed).  It turns out that the TCP in NT
<BR>
4.0 appears to handle a special case in the TIME_WAIT state
<BR>
differently from any BSD-derived TCP I have seen so far.
<BR>
<P>Let me first recap the behavior of BSD-derived TCPs: when a connection
<BR>
is in TIME_WAIT state and a SYN segment is received with a sequence
<BR>
number that is higher than the last received sequence number for the
<BR>
connection in TIME_WAIT state, then the existing connection is dropped
<BR>
immediately and the SYN is considered to be part of a new TCP
<BR>
connection.
<BR>
<P>The behavior of TCP as implemented in NT 4.0 SP3 (and possibly other
<BR>
versions of NT and Windows 95) appears to be different: when a new SYN
<BR>
segment is received for a connection in TIME_WAIT state, NT
<BR>
essentially ignores the SYN and simply sends back the last ACK for the
<BR>
existing connection.
<BR>
<P>Both the BSD and the NT behavior are fine as long as they're not
<BR>
mixed.  However, when trying to talk from a BSD-derived box to an NT
<BR>
box, serious performance problems may occur if the BSD box gets
<BR>
unlucky and happens to reuse a port number within the TIME_WAIT period
<BR>
of the NT box.  The tcpdump trace below illustrates the problem (the
<BR>
output has been edited for easier reading; the original trace is
<BR>
available by request):
<BR>
<P>------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
first connection:
<BR>
<P>42.55 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: S 192192000:192192000(0) win 16384
<BR>
42.55 nt40.80 &gt; hpux.1025: S 251663359:251663359(0) ack 192192001 win 8760
<BR>
42.55 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: . ack 251663360 win 16384 (DF)
<BR>
42.55 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: P 192192001:192192067(66) ack 251663360 win 16384
<BR>
42.56 nt40.80 &gt; hpux.1025: P 251663360:251664583(1223) ack 192192067 win 8694
<BR>
42.56 nt40.80 &gt; hpux.1025: F 251664583:251664583(0) ack 192192067 win 8694
<BR>
42.56 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: . ack 251664584 win 15161 (DF)
<BR>
42.56 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: F 192192067:192192067(0) ack 251664584 win 16384
<BR>
42.56 nt40.80 &gt; hpux.1025: . ack 192192068 win 8694 (DF)
<BR>
<P>second connection:
<BR>
<P>42.57 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: S 192256000:192256000(0) win 16384 &lt;mss 1460&gt; (DF)
<BR>
42.57 nt40.80 &gt; hpux.1025: . ack 192192068 win 8694 (DF)
<BR>
42.57 hpux.1025 &gt; nt40.80: R 192192068:192192068(0) win 16384
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>As the trace shows, a TCP connection exist between 42.55 seconds and
<BR>
42.56 seconds between ports 1025 and 80.  At the end of this
<BR>
connection, the NT 4.0 box (nt40) is in TIME_WAIT state as the FINs in
<BR>
both directions have been sent and acknowledged.  Then, at 42.57
<BR>
seconds, the hpux box attempts to create a new connection with the old
<BR>
port numbers (since BSD-derived TCP implementations consider this all
<BR>
right).  nt40 responds to this SYN packet by re-sending the last ACK
<BR>
for the first connection.  The hpux box in turn responds with a RESET
<BR>
since it was expecting a SYN segment from the nt40 box.  This
<BR>
SYN/ACK/RESET game repeats itself until the nt40 box moves the first
<BR>
connection out of the TIME_WAIT state, at which point the connection
<BR>
establishment proceeds normally.
<BR>
<P>To summarize, the apparent discrepancy between the TIME_WAIT state
<BR>
handling in BSD-derived TCPs and NT 4.0 TCP may result in serious and
<BR>
hard to detect performance degradation because TCP connections may be
<BR>
delayed for up to the duration of the TIME_WAIT period (i.e., 1-2
<BR>
minutes for most systems).  Note that this scenario is not academic: a
<BR>
busy client that has most of its TCP port numbers in use could quite
<BR>
easily run into this problem.  The problem is hard to detect because
<BR>
it occurs only intermittently (when the BSD-derived box gets
<BR>
&quot;unlucky&quot;) and because the connection establishment only gets delayed
<BR>
(albeit by a fairly large amount of time).
<BR>
<P>I'm interested to hear other people's opinion on what the correct
<BR>
behavior for this case is and suggestions on how to fix the current
<BR>
situation.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to thank Vern Paxon and Rick Jones for some initial
<BR>
discussions on this problem.
