<EM>&gt; Also, if you have 10K connections, you might need to send to many of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simultaneously, say when 10K users get back from their tea breaks or when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big football game pauses, and they all hit the ENTER key.   You might need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than 8KBytes of output buffering for each of many of your 10K
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connections.  (8K is puny in the late 1990's.)
</EM><BR>
<P>And the jerk who tries to give you 10K connections with the window jammed
<BR>
full of precisely non optimally delivered data
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; bring major qualitative changes.  People who expected to just crank up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; table sizes from 1 to 10 to 100 to ... and see things work have always (!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been amazed that I and my fellow pessimists have been proven right. 
</EM><BR>
<P>tcp hashes, select, poll, I/O compleiton callbacks - yep
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; best to find someone who's &quot;been there; done that&quot;, or at least &quot;tried to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do that.&quot;  Things are very different above 1000 connections compared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less than 100, and even people very experienced with smaller TCP systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are often surprised.  I suspect that's related to what the other people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who have responded have been hinting at.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just in load testing under Linux I've found the capture effects in TCP
<BR>
cut in and sessions jam up as others get busy under loading. Then your
<BR>
arp cache cant hold the 3000 local hosts apparently on your lan and begins to
<BR>
cycle entries, your timer code if its O(N^2) for insert/delete as most are
<BR>
starts eating cpu and things then becomes messy.
<BR>
<P>Finally just when you are having a bad day your acks all start to synchronize
<BR>
in bursts so they all vanish at the router to the outside world and your
<BR>
context switch rate takes a hike.
<BR>
<P>Even a sufficient rigged demo has problems at 30,000 parallel opens
<BR>
