<P>
One thought that just struck me is that we've all been bantering about
<BR>
with a 1460 MSS thinking primarily about 1500 byte MTU networks and how
<BR>
4096 is big enough for a 1500 byte MTU network and all that.
<BR>
<P>However, once someone takes that nice Apache (etc) application up to
<BR>
some (yes, possibly rare, but not unknown) larger MTU intranet (ATM,
<BR>
JumboFrame Ethernet, 802.5, etc) that &quot;4096 bytes of application
<BR>
buffering is fine&quot; thinking falls apart and we again have even sends
<BR>
that are sub-MSS.
<BR>
<P>Which, I think is yet another reason why if we codify anything it aught
<BR>
to be the explicit flush mechanism. That is the only thing that seems to
<BR>
have any chance of putting a serious dent in the use of TCP_NODELAY.
