<P>
KC-
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the note.  This is all my fault.  Part of it is the
<BR>
wording, and part is a portion of the algorithm that was left out.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     B.  Instead of reducing cwnd to ssthresh upon receipt of the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         non-duplicate ACK received (step 5), the sender should wait
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         until an ACK covering send_high is received.  In addition, each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         duplicate ACK received should continue to artificially inflate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         cwnd by 1 MSS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     C.  A non-duplicate ACK that does not cover send_high, followed by 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         duplicate ACKs should not reduce ssthresh or cwnd but SHOULD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         trigger a retransmission.  A non-duplicate ACK that does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         cover send_high SHOULD NOT cause any adjustment in cwnd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consider this case.  Both ssthresh and cwnd are 7*MSS.  Suppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sender sends segments 1-6.  1 and 5 are dropped.  After getting 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dup ACKs for segments 2-4, sender fast retransmits 1.  Ssthresh is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now 3*MSS and cwnd is set to 6*MSS.  Dup ACK for 6 is received and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cwnd is inflated to 7*MSS.  Thus one more segment, 7, can be sent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is fast recovery.  A non-dup ACK, for 1-4, is then received.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By B &amp; C, cwnd stays at 7*MSS.  By waiting in B, do you mean that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sender should not send anything after getting this non-dup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ACK?
</EM><BR>
<P>In this case &quot;waiting&quot; means that cwnd should not be reduced to
<BR>
ssthresh until receiving the first non-dup ACK that also covers
<BR>
send_high.  The fast retransmit algorithm, as specified in the draft
<BR>
in steps 1 - 5 can cause multiple fast retransmits for a window of
<BR>
data.  This is not a problem, except that this also causes cwnd and
<BR>
ssthresh to be reduced multiple times.  So, what we are saying is,
<BR>
let multiple fast retransmits happen, but ssthresh and cwnd should
<BR>
be reduced once per &quot;loss event&quot;.  So, cwnd should not be reduced to
<BR>
ssthresh upon receipt of a non-dup ACK, but wait for the receipt of
<BR>
a non-dup ACK that also covers send_high to make the reduction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If fast recovery is not stopped, then sender can now send segments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 8-11. Is this burst considered harmful?  If cwnd stays the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after getting a non-dup ACK for n segments that does not cover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send_high, TCP can send out n segments in a burst.  If we want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow the same idea behind fast recovery, cwnd can be reduced by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of segments acked when a non-dup ACK is received.  Ssthresh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can stay the same.  After send_high is ack'ed, cwnd is set to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ssthresh and everything continues.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly right.  That should be captured in the algorithm, but it is
<BR>
not.  If we don't reduce cwnd upon receipt of a partial ACK (non-dup
<BR>
ACK that doesnt cover send_high) we run the risk of injecting more
<BR>
data than appropriate into the network during recovery.  
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
