<EM>&gt; From: Greg Minshall &lt;<A HREF="mailto:minshall@siara.com?Subject=Re:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902170316.UAA16861@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">minshall@siara.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suffer the problem, or a pointer to a real application that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exemplifies the class of suffering applications.  These must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; applications that now suffer unnecessary latency on real world TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stacks on private nets or the Internet. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure we're converging, but let's try this:  for request-reponse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocols with variable-sized responses, with the current Nagle and delayed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ACKs, there is no way to write the server application such that some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percentage of the responses don't get delayed.  The modified Nagle allows an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application writer to write their application to avoid that particular delay.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's still only a sketch of an hypothetical application instead of a
<BR>
concrete pointer.  Do you have a name of a product? 
<BR>
<P>My intuition claims there are essentially no real applications that fit
<BR>
that sketch, and do not need to turn off the Nagle algorithm for other
<BR>
reasons.  The most common reason is the incompetant use of write-write
<BR>
instead of writev().  Another common but respectable reason is occassional,
<BR>
unidirectional traffic asynchronous with the main requests and responses.
<BR>
If your application has extra, one sided operations, such as updating
<BR>
unimportant status, then you must turn off Nagle, or the real requests will
<BR>
stall when they come.
<BR>
<P>It has been said that the proposal would wean users of write-write instead
<BR>
of writev to turning off Nagle.  I disagree.  They'll still reflexively
<BR>
turn off Nagle instead of using writev(), and won't notice the modified
<BR>
Nagle algorithm.
<BR>
<P>The modification is not free.  It's modest cost &lt;&lt;MUST&gt;&gt; have concrete
<BR>
beneficiaries!
<BR>
<P>I think you've convinced me the current Nagle algorithm is good enough
<BR>
for fixing telnet, that it does not matter to FTP, NFS, and other bulk
<BR>
applications, and it is and always will be turned off for HTTP and
<BR>
everything else for various good and bad reasons.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Here's something i mentioned to the Rick Jones (and the list); maybe this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helps:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Check out, for example, John Heideman's article in the  April, 1997,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review, or Henrik Nielsen, et  al,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from SIGCOMM 1997, for example of fairly well-crafted applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that  still run afoul of Nagle/delayed ACK interactions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you have an on-line reference?   A year or two ago, after 15 going on
<BR>
30 years of increasing irritation, the ACM's insistance on charging me
<BR>
for the nearly content-free, trade rag that CACM had become exhausted my
<BR>
patience and extravagance.  You can get ads separated by bogus statistics
<BR>
proving the wonders of the latest panacea for the Information Technology
<BR>
Crisis du jure for free, and with a lot less stilted pedantry.  And you
<BR>
don't get invoices with hefty &quot;contributions&quot; conveniently included.
<BR>
<P>I do recall seeing something somewhere about HTTP 1.0 and maybe 1.1 versus
<BR>
the Nagle algorithm.  As I vaguely recall it, even the proposed modified
<BR>
Nagle algorithm would still have to be turned off.  That's not the subject
<BR>
of those articles, is it?
<BR>
