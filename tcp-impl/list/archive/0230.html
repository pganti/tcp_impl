<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What problem would that be?  The only one I am aware of is a bug which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resulted in the PSH bit not getting set when the URG bit was on.  That has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been fixed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great!  What version of OT?  OT 1.1.1 is shipping in MacOS 7.6, but I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still seeing the problem of improperly missing PSH in 1.1.2 (net update
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribution).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't directly control our customers releases.  I would like to say that
<BR>
the URG-PSH problem should have been in 1.1.2, but I don't know for sure.  I'll
<BR>
try to find out.  Meanwhile, I get the feeling that you are complaining about
<BR>
something more than not setting the PSH bit when the URG bit is on, and I need
<BR>
to understand more specifically what else you are seeing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do you set the PSH bit in OT?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>In our implementation, on which OT TCP/IP is based, the PSH bit is turned on
<BR>
whenever we are sending the last piece of data that TCP has seen.  If we
<BR>
already have additional unsent data queued at TCP, the PSH bit is not set.
<BR>
End of story.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; According to Vinnie Moscaritolo:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #   Date: 12 Jun 96 00:59 GMT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #   The push flag feature of MacTCP is not functional in the the OT MacTCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #   implementation. Setting or resetting it does not ripple down to the OT TCP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #   Futher there is no way to programmaticaly set the push flag (PSH bit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #   header).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We had to revert our Mac web servers to MacTCP, where PSH works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Netscape hangs periodically when both ends of the connection are using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OT, but works better when the server is using MacTCP.
</EM><BR>
<P>The API associated with MacTCP included a mechanism for specifying that the
<BR>
PSH bit be set with a particular buffer.  As you know, RFC 1122 allows for,
<BR>
but does not require, such a facility.  I would be very happy to see this
<BR>
be explicitly discouraged.  The biggest problem with this capability is that
<BR>
application writers seem to think that by manipulating the PSH bit they can
<BR>
turn TCP into a low-rent messaging protocol.  This is an interoperability
<BR>
nightmare.  What is the upside?  If the sending and receiving TCPs are doing
<BR>
their job properly, then I don't see a good reason to allow the applications
<BR>
to get into the act.  Additionally, we, as protocol implementors, are often
<BR>
not in a postion to reinvent existing APIs regardless of what is &quot;required&quot;.
<BR>
<P>If your web servers don't respond properly given the simple PSH bit strategy
<BR>
described above, then I would very much like to get some actual details of the
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FYI:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also see no slow start when in the same /24, even tho not on the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subnet (physically divided /27).
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  If you are saying that we don't do slow-start when connected to a machine
<BR>
on the same subnet, that is not true.  We do slow-start on every connection.
<BR>
If you have evidence to the contrary, let's see it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also see no slow start after idle.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand the discussion on this point, and consider it fair game for
<BR>
recommendations by this group, but I need to understand why you are using it
<BR>
as criticism while this is not a requirement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also see no Nagle algorithm.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an almost slanderous misrepresentation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also see Ack-only packets immediately followed by data packets.
</EM><BR>
<P>More of the same.  ACKs should be deferred only so long, and may occur just
<BR>
before new data is sent.  If you have something to show me that looks like
<BR>
a systematic problem, please send it along and I will be happy to look at it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also see about 10% retransmissions, when no packets were lost due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congestion.  RTT algorithm needs work.
</EM><BR>
<P>OT 1.1.1 did include some serious RTT problems, which I take full
<BR>
responsibility for, that were very noticeable on slow links.  These have been
<BR>
resolved for some time, but did not make it into OT 1.1.2.  Apple has been
<BR>
promising to get these fixes out, but you will have to talk to them about
<BR>
when you will see them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I expect that this group will document all these behaviours as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;non-conforming&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm happy to discuss and examine any problems reported with our implementation.
<BR>
I certainly hope that this group will document only complaints supported by
<BR>
facts.
