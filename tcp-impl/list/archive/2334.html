<EM>&gt; S. Bellovin's discussion of the issues in RFC 1948 is good, except that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his discussion of the costs of MD5 hashing are dated.  CPU's are fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough that the cost of MD5 rarely matters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't agree that MD5 hashes of secrets are always required....not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that he says that, but that's what the test authors tell their customers.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are much easier ways to attack the ISN computation in most OS
<BR>
anyways than attacking MD5:  you attack the secret generation.
<BR>
<P>On diskless devices you can usually just find out the initial secret because 
<BR>
they have no easy way to restore the entry pool of the random generator from 
<BR>
disk. Unless the vendors implemented a hardware random generator the secret
<BR>
should be not too hard to guess.
<BR>
<P>[The rest of the discussion is primarily about Linux's /dev/random device
<BR>
because I know its implementation, but I believe similar issues apply to
<BR>
/dev/random equivalents on other OS] 
<BR>
<P>On many non diskless systems the entropy pool of /dev/random is restored from
<BR>
disk _after_ the first TCP connection, which makes similar guesses possible 
<BR>
[Linux fetches the secret for the first few minutes on the first connection]
<BR>
<P>The amount of entropy gathered during bootup is usually very small and rather 
<BR>
predictible (unless the users moves the mouse, which is usually not the case 
<BR>
on a firewall in a rack). 
<BR>
<P>The only source of randomness before the random pool is restored are the
<BR>
CPU time stamp measurements of the ide disk interrupt. Although there are
<BR>
some variances you can make some good guesses of the end result when
<BR>
the disk/hardware configuration is known (e.g. the case with many
<BR>
ready configured &quot;firewall appliances&quot; or just using the default OS 
<BR>
installation of the vendor) 
<BR>
<P>Even when the bug of doing TCP before the entropy pool restoring is fixed
<BR>
there are still some vunerabilities, because many firewalls etc. do never
<BR>
any disk io (assuming a separate log server) and never get keyboard/mouse 
<BR>
input. This means that the entropy pool stays pretty constant over time
<BR>
and the window of vunerability after boot time extends over the whole uptime.
<BR>
<P>As soon as you can guess the entropy pool you can guess the secret and
<BR>
attacking the ISN is trivial.
