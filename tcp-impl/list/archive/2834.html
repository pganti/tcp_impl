<EM>&gt;  TCP does not break, but the performance degrades.

<P>should it trigger the fast retransmit mechanism, yes. But it can also 
<BR>
improve - if I alternate segments over two disjoint paths of speed 
<BR>
&lt;mumble&gt;, my theoretical capacity is 2*&lt;mumble&gt;, and the degradation is 
<BR>
against theoretical capacity. If actual capacity used exceeds &lt;mumble&gt;, I 
<BR>
have a net improvement over using a single path. Or, if I am using a single 
<BR>
path a routing changes, and I have a temporary reordering that triggers 
<BR>
fast retransmit, the new route is likely to be stable, and the degradation 
<BR>
will only last for a few RTTs after that before undegraded service is restored.
<BR>
<P>My point is that the real alternative to accepting resolution of reordering 
<BR>
at the endpoints is doing something in the network while will guarantee 
<BR>
sequential packet ordering. That is something that could be pretty 
<BR>
interesting to design and implement in terms of complexity and brittleness 
<BR>
added to the network, and very possible has the same effects.
<BR>
<P>For example, suppose we decide that MPLS is the solution to the world's 
<BR>
problems in this area. Some say it is, and then ask &quot;what was your 
<BR>
question?&quot;. It would force packet order by forcing a single route - no 
<BR>
multipath routes - and by forcing the network to drain the traffic in 
<BR>
flight before imposing a new path when things change. Since TCP doesn't see 
<BR>
the routing change, the process of draining the network necessarily 
<BR>
involves dropping traffic, whether it is the traffic already in the 
<BR>
pipeline when an MPLS path changes, or by denying new traffic entry to the 
<BR>
network for a period of time, and maybe both.
<BR>
<P>Reordering has a certain probability of triggering fast retransmit - if the 
<BR>
session has four or more packets outstanding (relatively unusual) and drops 
<BR>
the first, the duplicate acks resulting from its successors will trigger 
<BR>
fast retransmit. The probability is relatively low, though - you might want 
<BR>
to read &quot;TCP Behavior of a Busy Internet Server: Analysis and Improvements&quot; 
<BR>
in INFOCOMM '98 on that. Behaviors which trigger reordering, however, have 
<BR>
a non-zero probability of delivering the traffic, while behaviors that drop 
<BR>
the traffic during the re-route event by definition do not. Which has a 
<BR>
greater effect on TCP, and on the applications it supports?
<BR>
<P>If you want to re-design fast retransmit to do so better, such as is done 
<BR>
in New Reno or in SACK, I'm all for that. But I really don't think that the 
<BR>
network behaviors which might eliminate reordering are improvements. They 
<BR>
require the network to support additional complexity, which itself is prone 
<BR>
to failures, and their cure may be worse than the disease.
