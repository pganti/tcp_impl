<P>
Sorry to go back on an old thread, but &quot;sending a garbage byte as a
<BR>
keep-alive&quot; makes testing more complicated.  I would like to
<BR>
discourage the practice (garbage bytes, not 1 byte keep-alives).
<BR>
<P>One useful tester would be a sniffer that ubiquitously validates that
<BR>
the association between &lt;connection 4 tuple&gt;.&lt;sequence number&gt; and
<BR>
&lt;payload data&gt; is always constant.  Such a sniffer could be run
<BR>
continuously in all TCP development labs and field test sites etc,
<BR>
alarming violations.  However, the garbage byte keep-alives makes the
<BR>
tester more complicated because it has to identify keep-alives and
<BR>
allow then as exceptions.
<BR>
<P>The exception logic makes the tester vastly more complicated,
<BR>
particularly because it needs to sniff both sides of the connection to
<BR>
monitor the advancing ACKs.  If you can't sniff both sides for some
<BR>
reason, there are heuristics that might work.  In any case the
<BR>
exception logic has the potential to mask bugs in the TCP
<BR>
implementations under test.
<BR>
<P>It would be much better if the keep-alive was always the correct valid
<BR>
data for the sequence in question (define pre-SYN data to be zero).
<BR>
Thus the tester could enforce a strong invariant on *ALL* TCP
<BR>
connections at all times: that the payload data associated with each
<BR>
sequence number (extended with a wrap count) is forever constant.
<BR>
<P>The requires changing &quot;MAY use a garbage byte&quot; to &quot;SHOULD use the
<BR>
correct data byte&quot;, even though the restriction is not needed for
<BR>
protocol correctness.
<BR>
<P>Now the meta-question: Is this in scope for TCP-Impl?  It seems to be
<BR>
that there could be a separate &quot;TCP Implementation guidelines for
<BR>
improved testability&quot;, which need not be a strong as protocol
<BR>
standard.  Perhaps a BCP?
<BR>
<P>Thoughts?
<BR>
<P>--MM--
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Or, since such a keepalive will always be outside the window (since it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; duplicates a sequence number that's already been acked - if you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unacked data outstanding, keepalives aren't even an issue), you can use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any value you please for the single data byte, as you suggest:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nothing says a stack may not use duplicate data over the original. There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some very simple embedded stacks that do this to save code. They just do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something akin to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	offset=diff_seq(buff_start, tcp-&gt;seq);
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	len=tcp-&gt;len;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	len=min(len, buffer_size-offset);
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	memcpy(...)
