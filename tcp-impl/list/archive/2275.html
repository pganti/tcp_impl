<P>
I know of no way of getting a guaranteed response from the other end of a TCP
<BR>
connection. I would love to hear of it if there is.
<BR>
<P>Connections can definitely be abandoned, you can definitely be left with the resources
<BR>
tied up for no reason, and you will definitely not have unlimited resources. And for
<BR>
most OS work rebooting is not an option, though this doesn't seem to be a general
<BR>
rule.
<BR>
<P>If you time-out TCP connections the time-out period has to be long ( I chose 24
<BR>
hours), but with the option of making it indefinite. Having a low priority task going
<BR>
through a million connections in that time is no big deal.
<BR>
<P>You could have the time-out task link inactive connections in inactivity order; and
<BR>
only kill the connection if you have to have the resources. The kill code using the
<BR>
linked list as the order to search for a connection to kill, the search would have to
<BR>
allow for the possibility the inactivity has stopped, but 99% of the time it would
<BR>
take the first connection in the list fins it is still inactive and claim the
<BR>
resources for the new connection.
<BR>
<P>In fact you could use the inactivity list in the same way as your free resources list.
<BR>
Instead of thinking of the resources as in use or free,  think of them as active or
<BR>
inactive, and only give up if the inactivity time of the resource your about to use
<BR>
falls below say an hour. The resource in question will have a flag to give the state
<BR>
of the connection just set them all to &quot;closed&quot; on start-up.
<BR>
<P>The low level task just goes through the table linking the list in inactivity order
<BR>
and sets a global &quot;load&quot; value. The claiming task searches down the &quot;inactivity list&quot;
<BR>
until it finds one that has a time greater than that represented by the&quot; load&quot;. At the
<BR>
head of the list you will only have two types of records, inactive connections, or
<BR>
connections that have recently become active and are not yet moved down by the
<BR>
time-out routine.
<BR>
<P>I like it, might be a worthwhile change, problem I now have is how many connections am
<BR>
I going to allow.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; see if the difference is greater than the TCP TIMEOUT value, If yes

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; remove the entry and add it to the free pool. It would be great if

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody could suggest other better methods.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is incorrect. A TCP session without keepalives has an infinite TCP_TIMEOUT.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You need to take slightly more active approaches to session tracking
