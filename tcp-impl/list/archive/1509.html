<EM>&gt; From: David Borman &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dab@BSDI.COM?Subject=Re:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902042330.QAA01201@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">dab@BSDI.COM</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; As I tried to say earlier, it's almost 20 years too late for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; considerations.  The PUSH bit irrevocably means what it now means,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think there is a mis-understanding here.  Setting MSG_PUSH means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; push this data through (and set the PUSH flag when it gets to TCP).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lack of the MSG_PUSH does not mean that the data is not sent, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the PUSH flag will not be set.  At least that's my thinking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But this may just be support for your agument to call it something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else than MSG_PUSH.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we agree.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe so, but I've doubts. ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, I've tossed around the idea of MSG_PUSH off and on for many years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the fact that I haven't done anything about it sort of says that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't even convinced myself that it is really needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had thoughts along those lines, but forgot to be offensive by mentioning
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I do think the change to Nagle is good (supported by the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I implemented it in BSD/OS over 2 years ago).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
Although I'm not convinced that BSD/OS sees really high traffic or as
<BR>
many installations as other systems.  Yes, BSD/OS is used on lots of
<BR>
web servers (and others such as this box), but I think the really big
<BR>
servers use boxes bigger than you can get with 80*86 CPU's.  The HP
<BR>
report is the overwhelming endorsement.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question is are there enough real-world situations where this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be worth-while.
</EM><BR>
<P>Attempts to change to ancient, extremely popular API's are awfully painful
<BR>
for eveyrone, and often unsuccessful in various ways.  Winsock 2.0 is an
<BR>
example of how more or less necessary changes can get out of hand.  (I've
<BR>
found the complications around select, non-blocking I/O, and WIN32 messages
<BR>
in winsock 2.0 ... engrossing.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; A other question is, if you have the modification to Nagle, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many of those carefully written applications that use TCP_NODELAY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could drop use of it?  Or would they still need TCP_NODELAY/MSG_NDELAY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they send multiple requests without waiting for a response
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the first request?
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe I don't understand the proposed modification, but I have the
<BR>
impression that the answer to that question is &quot;most of them.&quot;  It
<BR>
seems the modification helps only two sets of cases:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. bad code that does write-write-read-write-write-read-...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. odd cases such as write(&gt;1 segment but not a MBbyte)
<BR>
<P>If you have an application that involves lots of small random writes mixed
<BR>
with random reads, then TCP_NODELAY/MSG_NDELAY is unavoidable.  Perhaps
<BR>
X clients, as someone said.  Certain the code I'm currently bashing.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; The biggest trouble with MSG_NDELAY is the same as with writev().
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You'd have it where you don't really needed it (e.g. BSD systems)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but not where you do need it (e.g. winsock).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Patient: Doctor, it hurts when I do this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doctor: Then don't do that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride&quot;
