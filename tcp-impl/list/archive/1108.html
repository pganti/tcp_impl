<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the changes that are obviously necessary regardless of whether the proposal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is implemented near you, especially to increase the buffering on the ISP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; side of your modems to 16KBytes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Having 16K of buffering each end of a modem link is really bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please notice that I did not write &quot;each end&quot;.  That was not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oversight.
</EM><BR>
<P>My 28.8 is about the same packet usage for both ends. So a 'which end' assumes
<BR>
some kind of ISP-client relationship which limits the nature. Unless you
<BR>
mean &quot;not 16K tx buffer to modem and 16K rx buffer after modem the other
<BR>
end ?&quot; - Can you clarify
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I disagree with your implication that reordering based on packet size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a Purely Bad Thing.  My (SGI's) PPP and SLIP code did that for many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years without any reports of ill effects from customers or observations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of bad things by me.  In practice, that mechanism rarely reorders packets in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a single stream.  I changed the default setting of the hack only because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TOS bit setting became common, and the hack smells bad even if it does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no harm.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think RED is next to fiddle with
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also disagree with your statement elsewhere that common TCP applications are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not setting the TOS bits appropriately.  For half a dozen years at least
</EM><BR>
<P>wingate ? plenty of NT ftp servers too. Its not so far the big people or
<BR>
the clueful doing it, its the accumulation of everyone else. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; some major commercial outfits in both UNIX and PC worlds (e.g. FTP Software)
</EM><BR>
some is not all alas
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; buffering in all of the routers in all paths I care about.  If you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it for a little, I hope you'll see why your solution of reducing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the buffering in a single router is not sufficient to fix the problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you mention.  I've found a much better solution is to use smaller (2-4K)
</EM><BR>
<P>Its a fix that works in the convenient case of owning the bottle neck
<BR>
only yes. It does however work well for most victims simply because
<BR>
such nodes are normally the edge.
