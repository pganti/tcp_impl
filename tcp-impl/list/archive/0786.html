<EM> &gt; It's been awhile now that TCP SACK implementations have been 
</EM><BR>
available -
<BR>
<EM> &gt; see <A HREF="http://www.psc.edu/networking/tcp.html">http://www.psc.edu/networking/tcp.html</A> for a list -
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and I'm wondering what experience folks have had with the protocol.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; What are the behavioral effects on the TCPs using SACK, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; TCPs not using SACK, and the overall effects on the network 
</EM><BR>
traffic?
<BR>
<P>We implemented a user-level transport protocol based on UDP with 
<BR>
congestion control mechanisms similar to TCP. There is also a version 
<BR>
which uses FACK [1]. Using tests over the internet, we noted that 
<BR>
there were lots of unnecessary retransmissions with FACK. 
<BR>
<P>These were caused by not clearly separating between congestion 
<BR>
control and data recovery (as proposed in [2]): Data recovery relies 
<BR>
on the congestion control to be blocked long enough (about half an 
<BR>
rtt because of halving cwnd) before beginning to retransmit not yet 
<BR>
selectively acked packets. But towards the end of a recovery, very 
<BR>
often the situation arised that a packet was retransmitted shortly 
<BR>
before it was selectively acked. 
<BR>
<P>We also looked at the scoreboard algorithm from [2] where a packet is 
<BR>
only retransmitted after that three acks selectively acking packets 
<BR>
with higher sequence numbers have been received. There were almost no 
<BR>
unnecessary retransmissions and the timeout rate didn't increase.
