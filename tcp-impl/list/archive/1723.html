<EM>&gt; Mark Allman and I are just finishing final copy for a paper to appear in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SIGCOMM '99 that looks in detail at a number of these tradeoffs.  We'll send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an announcement to the list within a couple of days.  The brief version is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	(1) The moving average coefficients don't matter, so even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    you're running a lot more measurements through it with RTTM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    than previously, that has little effect on the effectiveness of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    the RTO computation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, I wonder if that statement holds in both senses: does doing all
<BR>
of the extra measurements also not *improve* the quality of the RTO
<BR>
computation?  I'd imagine that the key factor here would be transients
<BR>
such as initial slowstart or path changes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	(2) Finer granularity clocks are a win primarily because there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    less chance of the deviation being computed as 0 ticks (your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    last point above).  Below 100 msec you get diminishing benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    as you make the granularity finer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	(3) You don't really have to worry about things like timing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    last packet in flight because RTO has an implicit last-RTT term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    added into it (because the timer is restarted as new data is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    sent; pointed out by Reiner Ludwig).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm pretty sure that I've seen at least one implementation which
<BR>
doesn't do this.  To be honest, I was never quite able to figure out
<BR>
how you could *not* do this.  But the point which I thought was worth
<BR>
putting in writing somewhere is that you should only take a timeout if
<BR>
you believe *all* the packets in flight have been dropped.  As opposed
<BR>
to beleiving that *some* packet in flight was dropped.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	(4) The #1 biggest effect on how well the estimator performs is its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	    minimum value - there definitely should be a minimum RTO.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good to hear this.  I've been looking at this on and off for a little
<BR>
while now and was pretty convinced that there needed to be either a
<BR>
min RTO or a min deviation.  To my mind, the deviation term makes more
<BR>
sense to impose a minimum on, because even on long paths I believe you
<BR>
could still see the occasional spike in delay.
