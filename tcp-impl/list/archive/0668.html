<EM>&gt; From: Vern Paxson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vern@ee.lbl.gov?Subject=Re:%20does%20this%20qualify%20as%20a%20bug?&In-Reply-To=&lt;199708192210.PAA02816@rum.isi.edu&gt;">vern@ee.lbl.gov</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I talked with Van about slow-start after idle issues.  His basic argument is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any time you've lost the ack clock, you need to recover it, and the mechanism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for doing so is a slow-start.  So after 1 RTO (at which point you don't expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any more feedback from the receiver), you need to begin a new slow-start, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as though you were beginning a new connection.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So my leaning is that for the RFC 2001 revision, we add a description of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slow-start after 1 RTO idle, with a window the same as the initial connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window.  The behavior you described is indeed a bug, probably one that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very easy to make, and should be written up as such.  Clearly, we will need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be careful in our description of what exactly &quot;1 RTO idle&quot; means.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Agreed- there are separable issues:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- how to know when the clock is lost
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- what to do about it when you have new data to send
<BR>
<P>the bug is best aimed at the former; the latter is research (as you said)
<BR>
<P>however, 1 RTO idle may not be the best description of 'losing the ack
<BR>
clock'.  The clock is lost any time the window front moves forward
<BR>
without data to send.
<BR>
<P>For now, we can probably use the conservative 'if you've lost the
<BR>
clock for 1 RTO, then you _certainly_ have lost it'.
<BR>
<P>A better estimate would take into account the 'permission to send'.
<BR>
I would consider that a better fix to the bug, rather than 'research'
<BR>
per se.
