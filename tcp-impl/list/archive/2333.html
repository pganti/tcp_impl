<P><EM>&gt; Im not a cryptographer but Im being told MD5 should not be used by people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who are, and that people have found MD5 weaknesses that are not (yet) apparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in SHA
</EM><BR>
<P>You should check the credentials of your cryptographers or your
<BR>
understanding of what they said.  Even more than &quot;computer expert,&quot;
<BR>
people like to affect cryptographic expertise based on their need
<BR>
to be respected by their fellows down at the pub, or to sell
<BR>
&quot;computer security&quot; snake oil to people affecting computer expertise.
<BR>
<P>I don't claim to be a cryptographer, but my understanding is that the
<BR>
known weakness (singular, not plural) in MD5 would not be useful for a
<BR>
bad guy in this situation, where the bad guy does not know the value that
<BR>
is being hashed.  Even in situations where in theory the weakness matters,
<BR>
when the bad guy is trying to construct a second message that has the same
<BR>
MD5 hash value as a known, first message, it is completely useless in
<BR>
practice.  The known weakness only makes people worry that someone might
<BR>
know a secret way to compute a second message with the given MD5 hash
<BR>
value of another message, thereby forging a digital signature to the
<BR>
second message.
<BR>
<P>Note also that MD5 is not MD4, MD2, CRC-32, or other hashes that 
<BR>
have bad reputations for cryptographic applications.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Are people still using MD5 ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, for PPP CHAP and many other things with vastly stronger requirements
<BR>
than merely making it impractical to guess initial TCP sequence numbers.
<BR>
<P>That's not to say that if you need a digital signature, SHA is not
<BR>
a good and perhaps better choice.  However, we are not talking
<BR>
about digital signatures.
