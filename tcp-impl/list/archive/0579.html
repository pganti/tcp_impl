<EM>&gt; Given BLAM, I doubt fiddling with the ACK rate is justified for Ethernet.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Ethernet switches and full duplex cards (with one host per port,
<BR>
which is the trend), fiddling with the ACK rate is not justified
<BR>
since the capture effect is not there at the first place.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also fiddling with the ACK rate will change the rate at which cwnd
<BR>
increases, specially during slow-start.  If we ACK once every 4 packets,
<BR>
then this means cwnd will increase by 4 for each ACK, and 4 packets will
<BR>
be released into the net back-to-back. Back-to-back packets -&gt; capture
<BR>
effect. But again this is only during the slow-start phase which is
<BR>
short
<BR>
for reliable networks, the source's window hits the receiver's
<BR>
advertised
<BR>
window pretty quickly and stays stable at that value.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if anybody out there is doing research on how to regulate the
<BR>
back-to-back &quot;effect&quot;. It has been pointed out to me by others that
<BR>
selective ACKs combined with the FACK mechanism may provide a solution
<BR>
to this problem, but I don't see how. The source still does not have
<BR>
immediate information of how many packets left the network. The
<BR>
information is always delayed by the delayed-ACK period.
