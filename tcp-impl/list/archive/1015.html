Here are the minutes for the Washington meeting that Vern and I have
<BR>
hacked out over the past few days.  Thanks for Joe Touch and Bernie
<BR>
Volz for their meeting notes.  Any inaccuracies in these notes can
<BR>
be attributed to our weak memories.

<P>TCP-IMPL Meeting Minutes
40th IETF Meeting -- Washington DC
12-8-97 -- 12-11-97
<P>============================================================================
<P>These notes were compiled by Mark Allman and Vern Paxson based on notes
from Joe Touch and Bernie Volz (thanks!), as well as the co-chairs'
(possibly faint) memories of the meeting.
<P>============================================================================
<P>1.  additions to Known Problems I-D: Vern Paxson (10 min)
<P>Vern outlined a new problem catagory: resource management
<P>Vern outlined a few additions to the &quot;Known Problems&quot; I-D:
  -A low interval between keepalives can cost money on dial-on-demand links
<P>  -Stretch ACK Violation
<P>   A question about the definition of a &quot;full sized packet&quot; was
   raised.  A suggestion was made that this should be changed to a
   &quot;packet with data&quot;.  This would allow receivers to ACK every
   second packet with any data instead of waiting for 2 &quot;full
   segments worth&quot; of data to arrive.  (Actually, receivers are
   already &quot;allowed&quot; to do this.  RFC 1122 says the TCP must ack
   *at least* every two full sized segments, but acking more often
   is certainly permissible, too. - VP)
<P>  -Failure to send FIN notification promptly
  -Failure to send a RST after Half Duplex Close
<P>============================================================================
<P>2.  revisions to Testing Tools I-D: Steve Parker (5 min)
  
  (We don't recall any details concerning Steve's short presentation.)
<P>============================================================================
<P>3.  porting Packet Shell to libpcap: Steve Parker (10 min)
<P>  Steve Parker reported that Sun's packet shell is being ported to
  libpcap for greater portability.  Also, roughly 200 TCP tests have
  been added to the suite.  They are also porting UNH IPv6 tests (licensed
  from UNH) to this regression suite. [This is currently not available
  outside Sun.]
<P>============================================================================
<P>4.  TIME_WAIT problems: Joe Touch (5 min)
<P>  TIME_WAIT issues - Joe Touch gave a presentation on the time_wait
  accumulation issue, and discussed both application and protocol
  solutions. Joe presented the alternatives as either/or, in favor of
  the protocol solution, and asked the participants which solution to
  recommend.  There was support for both solutions, as well as encouragement
  that existing optimizations for dealing with large number of TCBs, such
  as hashing and ordering, should also be encouraged.
<P>  We [the co-chairs] believe there was a considerable body of opinion at
  the meeting that TIME_WAIT isn't really a significant problem, you just
  need to implement a decent hash table and you're done (per the final
  comment in the previous paragraph).  Unfortunately, in the absence of
  definitive notes, and given that neither co-chair has a clear recollection,
  we cannot state this more strongly [or rule it out as fantasy].
<P>============================================================================
<P>5.  slow-start restart bug: Joe Touch (5 min)
<P>  Joe Touch discussed various ways to re-start an idle connection.
  Joe presented 5 mechanisms for doing this...
<P>    1.	do nothing (i.e., just use same cwnd as before idle period)
    2.	slow start from 1 segment after not sending for 1 RTO
    3.	slow start from 1 segment after not receiving for 1 RTO
    4.	never send more than 4 segments (a 'maxburst' parameter)
    5.	never accumulate more than 4 segments of unused window
        (this was Joe's proposed solution)
<P>  A discussion followed.  Most people agreed the solution widely
  used (#3) was a bug because in the common case of, say, persistent
  HTTP, often the TCP has just received something (a request to
  send more data), so test #3 fails even though the TCP is quite idle.
<P>  Implementing solution #2 would require a new state variable (time of
  last send).  Solutions 2 and 3 can generate large line-rate bursts if
  connection is idle for less than 1 RTO, but does not continue to send
  new segments as ACKs are received.  Joe noted that solution 4 can also
  burst when ACK processing and send processing are not appropriately
  interleaved.  No consensus was generated on the appropriate approach.
  Joe offered to perform a comparison and give another report at the
  next meeting.
<P>============================================================================
<P>6.  checksum document (5 min)
  
  Vern presented a suggestion from Larry Backman: TCP checksumming
  documentation is spread over a large number of RFCs (RFCs 793,
  1071, 1122, 1141, 1626, 1936).  The suggestion is for a single
  document summarizing checksumming, including:
<P>    -algorithm
    -what to crunch on 
    -strategy (whole packet vs. incremental)
    -reference implementation
    -caveats/collected wisdom
<P>  Larry volunteered to work on a document from an implementor's
  perspective.  But, he requested help from an &quot;algorithm geek&quot;.
<P>  Consensus was that RFC 1071 already summarized checksumming quite
  well. 
<P>============================================================================
<P>7.  call for volunteers (5 min)
<P>  Vern asked (begged) for volunteers for the outstanding
  implementation problems that need documented.  The response
  was, as usual, underwhelming.
<P>============================================================================
<P>8.  initial slow-start (50+ min)
<P>  Sally Floyd briefly outlined the proposal for increasing TCP's
  initial window from 1 segment to 2--4 segments, depending on the
  MSS: 
<P>    	MSS &lt;= 1095 bytes:
	    win = 4 * MSS
	1095 bytes &lt; MSS &lt; 2190 bytes:
	    win = 4380
	MSS =&gt; 2190 bytes:
	    win = 2 * MSS
<P>  Sally argued that bursts of 2 and 3 segments are common in the
  Internet.  When TCP is in congestion avoidance and receives a
  delayed ACK, 2 segments are transmitted.  If TCP is in slow start,
  3 segments are transmitted.  Furthermore, bursts of 4 and 5
  segments are not rare.  If a single delayed ACK is dropped during
  congestion avoidance a burst of 4 segments is sent.  And, if one
  delayed ACK is dropped during slow start a burst of 5 segments is
  sent.  
<P>  Kedar Poduri then presented simulations of multiple flows using an
  initial window of 1--4 segments.  These simulations showed
  improvements to web type traffic when using larger initial
  windows, without large increases in the drop rate.  (Joint work
  with Kathie Nichols).
<P>  Tim Shepard presented the results outlined in his Internet Draft
  (draft-shepard-tcp-4-packets-3-buff-00.txt).  Tim showed that when
  using an initial window of 4 segments and a router buffer of 3
  segments (guaranteeing that the 4th segment would be dropped) the
  performance of the TCP connection was slightly better than using
  an initial window of 1 segment.  (Joint work with Craig
  Partridge). 
<P>  Mark Allman presented measurements of 16KB transfers across the
  Internet and dialup modem channels.  When using initial window of
  2--4 segments over the dialup channel, transfer time was decreased
  by roughly 7--10%.  In addition, the drop rate was not increased.
  In the Internet tests, the drop rate was increase very slightly
  with initial window of 2--4 segments.  Furthermore, the transfer
  time was reduced by 2, 15 and 25% for initial windows of 2, 3 and
  4 segments respectivly.
<P>  A discussion followed.  A consensus for an initial window of 2
  segments was obtained.  Some people felt that more evidence from
  real networks was needed before they would be comfortable with
  initial windows of 3 or 4 segments.  It was suggested that we
  accept an initial window as proposed (i.e., initial window of
  between 2 and 4 segments based on MSS) at the next meeting unless
  evidence that it is harmful is presented.
