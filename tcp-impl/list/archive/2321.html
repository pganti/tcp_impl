<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Only if they're trying to hack your statistics or debugging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I don't think (pls correct me if this is not the case) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anyone is proposing different receiver actions based on these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;codes; it's just for diagnoses, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Any information shot back to the sender of a SYN is potential information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; for a hacker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes! A SYN/ACK is info, the window size is info, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How does this _add_ compromises, is the question...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The info you listed is non-critical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I meant were the specific codes that have been suggested, such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;application abort&quot;, &quot;bad precedence&quot;, &quot;bad security&quot;, &quot;low memory&quot;, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This type of information is quite interesting for someone trying to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damage. All he would need to do is repeat the same SYN ad nauseum, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if he keeps getting &quot;application abort&quot;, he is well on his way to crash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your server. Is this compromise enough?
</EM><BR>
<P>Any response means he is succeeding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Responding with &quot;bad precedence&quot; or &quot;bad security&quot; is synonymous with inviting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him to try a few other values. This _adds_ compromise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bad precedence just means subsequent packets didn't match the precedence
<BR>
bits. We already know that they can be changed, and sending two packets
<BR>
with different values is sufficient to guarantee a crashed connection in
<BR>
that case. This isn't particularly interesting.
<BR>
<P>Bad security makes no sense; TCP has no security (SSL does, so does
<BR>
IPSEC, but then _THEY_ should carry that info, or not. not TCP :-) It'd
<BR>
be inappropriate to send a RST in response to failed SYN authentication
<BR>
(to counter DOS attacks); silence is the best response there anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A simple empty RST doesn't give him any of this information so he doesn't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you are just not listening on that port or that you rejected his attempt.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. He knows you're listening, and that you've responded. Otherwise,
<BR>
you'd have to have been spamming the world with RSTs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He can't use the information of why you rejected a particular connection attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against you because he doesn't know it. Adding a code to the RST provides this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacker with the information he needs to fine-tune his attack to bring your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server down.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no new information here that is useful. So he tries again. He
<BR>
can do that now. The RST has to have information that CHANGES how he
<BR>
attacks you; there isn't enough info (at least in my view of what's
<BR>
included) to do that.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you're that worried about hackers, use IPSEC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regarding IPSEC, remember that there are many reasons to use TCP _without_ IPSEC,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a web server is a good example.
</EM><BR>
<P>Web servers can use IPSEC for authentication. A web server wouldn't get
<BR>
too many RSTs in response to SYNs, because they typically answer (not
<BR>
initiate) connections. Sure, it could get RSTs in response to SYN/ACKs,
<BR>
but it can do that now.
