<EM>&gt; From: der Mouse  &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mouse@Rodents.Montreal.QC.CA?Subject=Re:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902041440.HAA21740@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">mouse@Rodents.Montreal.QC.CA</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that do support TCP_NODELAY.  Instead, let's wait for the few, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any, announcements of those that don't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect this won't work very well.  I feel quite sure that having a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; representative on tcp-impl correlates positively, and probably fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strongly, with having a relatively decent implementation.  Thus, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who could truthfully chime in as you request - even assuming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they'd be willing to publicly admit their failing - are the people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably won't see the question.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's all quite right, but the problem applies even more to the other
<BR>
tactic of collecting notes about systems whose advocates claim work
<BR>
correctly.
<BR>
<P>There's also the issue of why the IETF cares whether any particular
<BR>
implemetation does or does not implement TCP_NODELAY.  It's one thing for
<BR>
to define a standard, and quite another thing to monitor, test, or
<BR>
otherwise worry about the compliance of every implementation deployed or
<BR>
announced.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The only way I expect to see &quot;&lt;foo&gt; doesn't do this right&quot; here is from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who wrote code that tried to disable Nagle (eg, TCP_NODELAY)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and then discovered in a packet trace that it was happening anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>In general, that's also probably true.  However, if you have an application
<BR>
which uses TCP_NODELAY because it is undesirable for it to follow the
<BR>
rules (e.g. does things like write-write-read-...) and so gets hit by the
<BR>
Nagle+delayed_Ack interaction, you probably won't need to packet trace to
<BR>
have the problem brought to your attention.  The performance effects are
<BR>
hard to miss.
<BR>
<P>I have such an application, but it wouldn't be helped by the proposal
<BR>
because its naughty writes are too small.  It still needs TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
Such is life.
