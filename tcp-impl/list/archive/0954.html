<P>Opening the window has a semantic implication that does not apply if the

<P><EM>&gt; The only other option that may make sense to discuss is whether the

<EM>&gt; &quot;receiving TCP&quot; just resets the connection when there is data on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive queue when the application &quot;closes&quot; the socket (in such a way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it can no longer read that data). I don't a strong opinion on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether this is better (we could argue that it isn't because most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementations open the window and reset if more data is received).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that this approach would be better because it does not give the
<BR>
mistaken impression that data has been given to the application.
<BR>
<P>I still wonder though if this is not really an application issue.
