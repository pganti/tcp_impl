<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; The misbehaving TCP did not always set the PSH bit in the last data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; segment but still expected that data to be delivered to the application.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;This looks like it's okay.  RFC 793 (section 3.7, page 41) says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The CLOSE user call implies a push function, as does the FIN control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; flag in an incoming segment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Neither the local nor remote applications closed the connections. If
<BR>
that had 
<BR>
happened, everything would have worked out fine. This was an interactive
<BR>
<P>application data exchange. The remote application sent the data without 
<BR>
the PSH bit and was waiting for a reply from the local application.
<BR>
However, 
<BR>
the local TCP was waiting for the PSH bit (or local CLOSE or FIN from
<BR>
peer) 
<BR>
which never came. This caused a connection deadlock.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;and I didn't see wording in RFC 1122 overruling this, though maybe I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;missed it.
</EM><BR>
<P>RFC 1122, section 4.2.2.2, first paragraph:
<BR>
&quot;...when a series of segments is received without the PSH bit, a TCP may
<BR>
queue the data internally without passing it to the receiving
<BR>
application.&quot;
<BR>
<P>third paragraph:
<BR>
&quot;If PSH flags (on application send calls) are not implemented, then the
<BR>
sending 
<BR>
TCP: (1)....(2) MUST set the PSH bit in the last buffered segment (i.e.,
<BR>
when 
<BR>
there is no more queued data to be sent.&quot;
<BR>

<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; I have seen a number of implementations that seem to depend on the PSH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; bit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;If this means that they won't ultimately deliver all of the data if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the last segment doesn't include a PSH, then that definitely seems worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;documenting.  (A bit hard to show from a trace, I guess ...)
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to me, that the sender MUST set the PSH bit in the last data 
<BR>
segment to be delivered to an application (unless a FIN bit is set).
<BR>
If it's an interactive application, it's difficult to know when to give
<BR>
the data
<BR>
to the application if the PSH bit is not set. Short of inventing a
<BR>
timer, I don't know 
<BR>
what the algorithm would be.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; ... I would like to see the RFC amended to say the PSH bit is advisory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; on when to deliver data to the app but a stack should deliver data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless of the PSH bit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Maybe this should instead be worded in terms of: stacks must ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;deliver data even if they don't ever receive a PSH?  (Because in 793,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;beginning of section 2.8, it sounds like PSH is mandatory and not advisory.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, if a receiving TCP can't depend on the sender to set the PSH bit,
<BR>
what 
<BR>
would the algorithm be on when to give data to the application?
