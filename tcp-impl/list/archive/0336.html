<P>
Steve,
<BR>
<P>I have some comments about the minutes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Braden asked what percentage of the attendees are or have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementors.  Relatively few of the attendees appeared to be.
<BR>
<P>He asked two very different questions, and got different responses.
<BR>
1) Who is currently responsible for supporting a TCP implementation.
<BR>
2) Who has supported a TCP implementation in the past.
<BR>
<P>Question 1 got nil response, but the word &quot;responsible&quot; means
<BR>
management in many contexts (E.g. a coding wizard is never
<BR>
&quot;responsible&quot; for anything).  Also I wondered if some TCP shops didn't
<BR>
send non-responsible ringers to collect info and avoid any contamination
<BR>
issues.
<BR>
Question 2 got non-nil response, but could mean many things....
<BR>
Since the interpretations are ambiguous, I would consider dropping the
<BR>
item, or at least use more nuetral language.  Was &quot;about half&quot; correct?
<BR>
<P>----------
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Mathis raised the issue of backward compatibility and suggested
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that workarounds for defective implementations should be well-known,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easy to test for, and easy to disable in the event that they cause
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance overhead when not actually needed.
<BR>
<P>I think said something stronger:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In cases where workarounds interfere with new features there is a
<BR>
strong market disincentive for the new features because they often
<BR>
will be the only implementations that fail to interoperate with the
<BR>
dinosaurs [older buggy versions].  .... tcpimpl should document these
<BR>
cases and consider recommending against the workarounds, such that both
<BR>
the dinosaurs and workaround become non-compliant.  Vendors could then
<BR>
market backward compatibility [as a separate product in an alternate
<BR>
release] while moving to the new [incompatible] features.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately I repeated slightly different version of the above words in
<BR>
different contexts, and don't remember precisely which were in front of
<BR>
the tcp-impl mic.
<BR>
<P>----------
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Mathis suggested that part of the above problem is due to failure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to agree on what how long of a time value is used to determine whether
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or not the connection is &quot;idle.&quot;  This borders on a research issue;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more discussion seems to be needed.
<BR>
<P>No, I suggested:
<BR>
<P>Amending &quot;no slow-start after idle&quot; by inserting the word &quot;long&quot;
<BR>
before idle.  [I observed] that correct behavior after &quot;short idle&quot; is
<BR>
an open research question, as are the precise definitions of &quot;long&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;short&quot;.  However there are TCP implementations that do not
<BR>
slow-start after an hour of idle, and this is unambiguously incorrect,
<BR>
and not a research question.
<BR>
<P>----------
<BR>
<P>Thanks,  It was fun and productive!
