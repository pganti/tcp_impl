<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sender transmits packets 1, 2, ... 10. Packet 1 gets lost. The retransmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; of packet 1 upon getting 3 duplicate ACKs also gets lost. The duplicate ACKs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; generated due to packets 5 - 10 cause the sender to send new packets (11
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; - 15).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't believe that this will happen, if based on taking rfc 2001's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; description of fast recovery literally (see P4).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is because cwnd is set to ssthresh + 3*seg_size, after ssthresh has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been halved. As I've coded it, this usually causes my simulation model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to stop sending, becausethe halving of ssthresh is not compensated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; adding 2*seg_size. If it had taken the old, un-halved ssthresh, it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be OK.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is completely incorrect. The primary reason behind fast recovery is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to send half the segments that were sent before detecting the loss. Just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to satisfy you, here's how it will happen:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Congestion window before detecting loss = 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ssthresh after detecting loss = 10/2 = 5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congestion window immediately after detecting loss = 5+3 = 8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amount of unacknowledged data in the network = 10
</EM><BR>
<P>Thus ACKs for segment 5-10 will push the window to 13, and hence
<BR>
segments 11-13 will be sent, and not 11-15 as in your last e-mail. The
<BR>
duplicate ACKs for these would then cause segments 14-16 to be sent,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent loss, would, I agree, give further linear reduction. As to
<BR>
your supposition about going straight into slow-start, I must think
<BR>
about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Congestion window is now increased upon getting every duplicate ACK. As soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it becomes greater than 10 (amount of unacknowledged data), the sender would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start sending again.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Thanks for the clarification.
<BR>
<P>I think describing my previous relpy as 'completely incorrect' is a
<BR>
little harsh. In order to 'start sending again', it must first 'stop'.
<BR>
<P>In your above example TCP does in fact stop sending, until either:
<BR>
a) Two more ACKs arrive, which should happen fairly soon provided no
<BR>
other segments were lost, or
<BR>
b) An ACK for a presumed lost (but possibly delayed) segment arrives, in
<BR>
which case the window moves forward, cwnd gets reset to ssthresh, etc.
<BR>
<P>Although I admit that such a 'stop' might better be termed a (very
<BR>
temporary) stall, which would only really be detrimental on high BW
<BR>
networks (as you state).
