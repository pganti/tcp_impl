<EM>&gt;Seriously we were forced into reclaiming the oldest time-wait connection(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a queue rather than continueing to allocate memory till we ate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Traffic pattern was of course shaped by web servers who had thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incoming connections which had not been cleanly closed by browsers/http
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;test programs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Rather than just tossing out the oldest time-waiter, it would be better
<BR>
to grab the last sequence number information from that socket and make
<BR>
sure to offer a sequence number just following that on the new connection.
<BR>
If I recall correctly BSD boxes already do this if there is an incoming
<BR>
connection to a specific port that is in TIME_WAIT, and recent Linux
<BR>
releases (2.0 or older) do this as well. It should be possible to extend
<BR>
this behavior to looking for a free port. This would at least keep
<BR>
the sequence number space advancing correctly over successive connections.
<BR>
<P>As to the concern about eating all of memory, it probably makes sense
<BR>
to reduce TIME_WAITer's to a smaller control structure. Most of the
<BR>
stuff in the TCP isn't needed. I think you can get away with a timer,
<BR>
the endpoint addresses and the last sequence number, but I haven't
<BR>
thought about this for a while. You'll still potentially need a couple
<BR>
of megabytes of memory, but on a web server taking thousands of
<BR>
connections a minute this is probably acceptable.
<BR>
<P>Of course none of this deals with the various other ways that TCP
<BR>
connections can get into a non-synchronized state with the potential
<BR>
for data duplication. My current favorite candidate for this is
<BR>
dynamic IP addresses assigned by an ISP. One box drops off the net,
<BR>
to be replaced by another with the same address, and with no knowledge
<BR>
of the port numbers being used by the previous user of that IP address.
<BR>
Lots of scenarios for bad things to happen there. Alan Cox has already
<BR>
mentioned Ian Heavens's draft on the subject.
