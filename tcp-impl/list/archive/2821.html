<P>CALL FOR PAPERS
<BR>
<P>The ACM Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking &amp; Computing
<BR>
MobiHoc 2003
<BR>
<A HREF="http://mobihoc.ee.ucla.edu">http://mobihoc.ee.ucla.edu</A>
<BR>
<P>June 1-3, 2003
<BR>
Annapolis, Maryland, USA
<BR>
<P>MobiHoc 2003 is the fourth of a series of annual meetings sponsored by
<BR>
ACM SIGMOBILE, focusing on the latest research in the rapidly growing
<BR>
area of mobile ad hoc networking and computing. The first MobiHoc was
<BR>
held in 2000 in Boston, Massachusetts, as a workshop affiliated with
<BR>
the MobiCom conference also sponsored by SIGMOBILE. Since then, MobiHoc
<BR>
has become a separate symposium, held in 2001 at Long Beach,
<BR>
California, in 2002 at Lausanne, Switzerland, and now in 2003 at
<BR>
Annapolis, Maryland.
<BR>
<P>Papers:
<BR>
<P>Technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research,
<BR>
not currently under review by another conference or journal, are
<BR>
solicited. In general this symposium is interested in papers that
<BR>
address networking or computing problems in the context of mobile and
<BR>
wireless ad hoc networks, ad hoc computing systems, and sensor
<BR>
networks, with the focus being on issues above the physical layer.
<BR>
Specific topics of interest include the following:
<BR>
<P>* Routing protocols (unicast, multicast, geocast, content-based etc.)
<BR>
* Media access techniques
<BR>
* Transport-layer issues
<BR>
* Hardware and software platforms, systems, and test beds
<BR>
* Applications for ad hoc networks
<BR>
* Power-aware, low-power, and energy-efficient designs
<BR>
* Quality-of-service issues
<BR>
* Security and fault tolerance issues
<BR>
* Self-configuration in ad hoc networks
<BR>
* Processing and fusion of data in sensor networks
<BR>
* Location discovery and management
<BR>
* Timing synchronization
<BR>
* Distributed algorithms for ad hoc networks
<BR>
* Biologically inspired mechanisms
<BR>
* Ad hoc networks of autonomous intelligent systems
<BR>
* Analytic methods and modeling for performance evaluation
<BR>
* Cross-layer interactions, including between higher and physical layers
<BR>
<P>* Other ad hoc networking and computing topics above the physical layer
<BR>
<P>Please consult the program co-chairs Anthony Ephremides

<BR>
are uncertain whether your paper falls within the scope of the
<BR>
symposium.
<BR>
<P>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:
<BR>
<P>All submissions will be handled electronically and must be in PDF or
<BR>
PostScript format. Papers must not exceed 15 pages (US &quot;Letter&quot; size,
<BR>
8.5 x 11 inches) including text, figures and references. The font size
<BR>
must be at least 10 points. Accepted papers will be published in the
<BR>
symposium proceedings.
<BR>
<P>We will adopt a double-blind process for paper review, where the
<BR>
identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. Authors'
<BR>
names and their affiliations must not be revealed or mentioned anywhere
<BR>
in the paper or in the postscript or PDF file. Submitted papers should
<BR>
be unpublished and not currently under review for any other conference
<BR>
or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be summarily
<BR>
rejected.
<BR>
<P>To submit a paper, please refer to the paper submission link at the
<BR>
conference website, <A HREF="http://mobihoc.ee.ucla.edu">http://mobihoc.ee.ucla.edu</A>. Questions about the
<BR>
submission process should be directed to the Program Co-Chairs.
<BR>
<P>TUTORIALS
<BR>
<P>Proposals for tutorials are solicited. Evaluation of proposals will be
<BR>
based on the expertise and experience of the instructors, and on the
<BR>
relevance of the subject matter for the symposium. Potential
<BR>
instructors are requested to submit a tutorial proposal of at most 5
<BR>
pages, including a biographical sketch, to the Tutorial Co-Chairs,
<BR>
Edward Knightly &lt;<A HREF="mailto:knightly@ece.rice.edu?Subject=Re:%20MobiHoc%202003%20-%20Call%20for%20Papers&In-Reply-To=&lt;3D66C070.EDEA41D0@cwc.ucsd.edu&gt;">knightly@ece.rice.edu</A>&gt; and Magda El
