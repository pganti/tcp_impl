<EM>&gt; From: Henrik Frystyk Nielsen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:frystyk@w3.org?Subject=Re:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902180027.RAA15423@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">frystyk@w3.org</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I too do application level buffering with all the problems of figuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out what a good buffer size is (I ended up using 1K as a compromise). In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most cases this mean I don't need Nagle at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But, from an architectural viewpoint, I think it makes a lot more sense if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't have to do that at the application layer and that I instead could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep the services separated. This means that I need enough control to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to indicate what I want - an explicit flush is one of those hooks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Today, I don't have that so I have to repeat a lot of the functionality in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a layer above and short-circuit things like Nagle in lower layers.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a fair argument, but I don't see how it actually applies here.
<BR>
<P><P>Case 0: no buffering, Nagle off, use flush bit
<BR>
Case 1: no buffering, Nagle off, don't use flush bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same packets on the wire in either case...far too many!
<BR>
<P>Case 2: you don't buffer, leave Nagle on, and use the flush bit.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your writes of slow data generally go out immediately, because you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send them when things are idle.  When you have fast data, you use the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flush bit, so they also go out immediately instead of possibly being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delayed for an Ack of slow data.  The result on the wire is too many
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets, almost as bad as #0 and #1.  The only improvement in packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counts over #0 and #1 is when you happen to send slow data within
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 ms after receiving fast data or send 2 slow bursts within 100 ms.
<BR>
<P>Case 3:  you buffer, leave Nagle on, and use the flush bit
<BR>
Case 4:  you buffer, turn Nagle off, and do not use the flush bit.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both cases have the similar application code complexity and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same, minimal count of packets on the wire.
<BR>
<P>Case 5-7:  boring.
<BR>
<P>Do you agree that #0 #1 are bad, and so you pick either #3 or #4?
<BR>
<P>Given that #4 works everywhere today and forever, why would you ever bother
<BR>
to code #3?  For the architectual purity seal of approval?
<BR>
<P><P>What's the difference between a flush bit in the send() system call, and
<BR>
explicit setsockopt()'s turning off TCP_NODELAY off before a send() and
<BR>
on afterwards?  No, I don't like system call overhead--I'm asking what
<BR>
happens on the wire.
