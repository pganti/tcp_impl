<P>
- &gt; SunOS 5.x already has such an interface.
<BR>
- 
<BR>
- I assume you mean via the streams API?
<BR>
<P>No, actually, raw TCP sockets, although not documented, have been a part
<BR>
of SunOS 5.x pretty much since 5.0.  It is something we haven't documented
<BR>
because we don't want our user's depending on it, in no small part because
<BR>
there has been no concensus about what a SOCK_RAW IPPROTO_TCP socket's
<BR>
semantics are.  If an RFC were drafted in this area, I would expect
<BR>
we would document and conform to that behavior.
<BR>
<P>You certainly can get at them via the streams interfaces, too.
<BR>
<P>- Historically, IP_HDRINCL has only applied to outbound packets.
<BR>
- Also, all other SOCK_RAW sockets return the IP header, so that is
<BR>
- why I left it there (even though it is quite munged...)
<BR>
<P>Yes, and I suppose being inconsistent in what the option means between
<BR>
different protocols probably isn't helpful.  I certainly wouldn't mind
<BR>
having an option indicating whether or not I get and send the IP headers,
<BR>
though.  Mostly, though, I see myself wanting to ignore the IP headers
<BR>
though....
<BR>
<P>- &gt; We support doing a connect() as well as a bind() on such sockets.  This
<BR>
- 
<BR>
- Yes, I also support connect().  I was trying to keep my initial message
<BR>
- from being too long, and I neglected to mention that connect() also works,
<BR>
- allowing you to fully specify the TCP connection that you want raw access to.
<BR>
<P>Excellent.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
