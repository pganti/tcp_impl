<P>I don't understand what specifically you are complaining about.
<BR>
<P>While the *default* keepalive interval MUST be no less that 2 hours,
<BR>
system A may have been configured with a shorter interval, which is
<BR>
specifically allowed.  Only if system A's default configuration results
<BR>
in keepalives of less than 2 hours is there ground for complaint.  I
<BR>
take &quot;configurable&quot; here to mean by, for example, kernel reconfiguration.
<BR>
So the application itself may not be able to control the keepalive
<BR>
interval, only whether keepalives are used or not.
<BR>
<P>As a practical matter, I have often needed the ability to configure
<BR>
a keepalive interval of a few minutes, and considered the bandwidth
<BR>
used well worth the assurance of peer survival, in cases where the
<BR>
higher-level protocols had no easy keepalive mechanism of their own.
<BR>
I would prefer the ability to set the keepalive interval from an
<BR>
application on a specific connection, but alas that is not required
<BR>
by RFC 1122.
