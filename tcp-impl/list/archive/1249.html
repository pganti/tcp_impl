<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk?Subject=Re:%20Timeout%20in%20FIN-WAIT-2&In-Reply-To=&lt;199808201910.NAA10295@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk</A> (Alan Cox)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I do not understand that reasoning.  Yes, in the best of all possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worlds, it might be that all applications would have keepalives.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now the odds of a keepalive on my imap mail connection as I browse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; email occuring is pretty slim - and if it occurs its one packet. Now if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you had a 5 minute keepalive the odds of it occuring are a lot, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are generating a lot more packets per user for idle &quot;still reading that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; email, gone for a coffee&quot; etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>5 minutes is below the value that I consider silly or at least
<BR>
objectionable for a TCP keepalive even for HTTP.  Never mind that real
<BR>
systems servering 10,000,000 hits/day are often forced to use that
<BR>
particular value to avoid crashing by running out of system resources.
<BR>
I guess reality is often silly or at least objectionable.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; convinced that you would not then complain even more loudly about wasted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bandwdith al la the complaints about such things as the Appletalk 15-second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; babble, but never mind.  The fact is that applications do not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keepalives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Appletalk doesnt run over 1200 and 9600 baud connections
</EM><BR>
<P>That's irrelevant, and not just because no one today is using 1200 or
<BR>
9600 bit/sec connections.  At least in the U.S., everyone is using at
<BR>
least v.32bis.  The complaints about the Appletalk 15-second (or was it
<BR>
5-sec?) concerned LANs.  Why would you be less offended by ~80 byte
<BR>
HTTP/TCP/IP keepalives than by 40 byte TCP/IP keepalives, both at the same
<BR>
rate?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question is whether people should fix the apps or we should accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their idiocy and cover for them. Unfortunately I suspect the answer is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a marketing not a technical one. 
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are offended by TCP keepalives, then work to make it illegal for
<BR>
the IESG to approve protocols withtout application layer keepalives.
<BR>
Until you finish that task, you should be insisting in the relevant working
<BR>
groups that revisions of existing protocols (e.g. SMTP) all be given
<BR>
application layer keepalives.
<BR>
<P>Does the new HTTP have a keepalive?  I don't think so.  If I'm not wrong,
<BR>
what have you done to fix that particular and currently worst aspect of
<BR>
the problem?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Either way getting POSIX to define a socket option for timeout setting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is probably a good thing (there are valid internal network cases cited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already where its nobody elses business what people do to their lan)
</EM><BR>
<P>Why are TCP keepalives a problem out in the open?  Are you saying that an
<BR>
HTTP keepalive would use less bandwidth than the current practice?
