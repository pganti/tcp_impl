<EM>&gt; &gt; My guess would be probably not. The client will be able to send data -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the connection is ESTABLISHED, and that data will likely be accepted and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ACKed. My guess would be that those connections in the listen queue will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stay there for quite a long time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Assuming client sends data for the ESTABLISHED connection which is queued
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the socket receive buffer on the server side and the data fills the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buffer, then I presume the client's TCP will never get any ACKs for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; additional data sent and will eventually timeout which is the retransmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timeout.
</EM><BR>
<P>While there are some stacks that &quot;lie&quot; about their window and amount of
<BR>
data they can store, 99 times out of ten, if the receive socket buffer
<BR>
is full, the sender has a zero window, and so unless it is broken, will
<BR>
not be sending and data that will be dropped without an ACK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Basically until the client gets fed-up with a lack of response and closes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Any idea of the situations when it would get fed up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Client-level timeouts, people sitting at keyboards hitting ^C, or &quot;STOP&quot;
<BR>
buttons. That sort of thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Or, you explicitly accept and close them yourself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   In my case server won't accept() or close() the connections as it is out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of FDs and it will do so only if the FD count goes down. The problem here is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that any data sent by client using the ESTABLISHED connection will be put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into socket receive buffer and will probably be ACKed. But if I issue an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept() call, it will reap a connection from the listen queue and will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overlay the connection onto a FD whose creation will fail as the server is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of FDs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just what is your FD limit? On the &quot;enterprise ready&quot; :) platforms, or
<BR>
at least two with which I'm slghtly familiar, the per-process FD limit
<BR>
is either 32768 or 60000 - the kernel being configured apropriately.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you really want those connections to go away without more direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intervention, you might want to use an interface that inserts the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; application between the receipt of the SYN and the sending of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SYN|ACK. I _think_ XTI is or can be such an interface. In that case, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would simply stop taking the request notificatoins and the clients would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; timeout on their connects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   This is out of question right now with the tight schedules.
</EM><BR>
<P>As others have pointed-out, which the XTI interface routines and their
<BR>
descriptions imply what I thought would happen, the actual
<BR>
implementations may not behave quite that way.
