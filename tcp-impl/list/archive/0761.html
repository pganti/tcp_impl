<EM>&gt; &gt; Presumably this means that ssthresh should be reset when congestion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; occurs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More exactly, when TCP responds to a loss, by either a timeout retransmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or beginning a fast retransmit/fast recovery sequence, it first sets ssthresh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on the value of cwnd in effect at the time of the loss.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have observed (ina simulation) that if congestion occurs then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; multiple segments tend to be lost or timeout, cwnd is set to MSS after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the first loss ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For a timeout retransmission, this is correct behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ... and hence ssthresh is set to 2*MSS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is incorrect.  ssthresh is supposed to be set *first*, to half of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current value of cwnd.  This happens before cwnd is set to 1 MSS to begin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slow start.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If cwnd was sufficiently large to begin with, then the only normal circumstance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which ssthresh should be set to 2*MSS is if the retransmitted packet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself lost (or if the slow start following the retransmission doesn't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very far before there's a loss).  In that case, ssthresh (again) gets set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to half of cwnd, which gets rounded up to the minimum value of 2*MSS if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thus, I take this mean that ssthresh should be reset to half the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; window size when congestion occurs, but should not be reset until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; congestion goes away ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's no explicit notion of congestion going away.  The algorithm is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that ssthresh is always set to cwnd/2 (modulo rounding) when a fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retransmission begins or a timeout retransmission occurs.  If you have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timeout retransmission that is itself lost, then yes, ssthresh is set to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MSS*2 - and that's what you want, because the net is still congested, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you must proceed gingerly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>What I am observing in my simulation model is that if a segment gets
<BR>
delayed, then all the other segments behind it also get delayed. The
<BR>
timers for all of these expire, and after the timer for the second has
<BR>
expired cwnd and ssthresh are down 2*MSS. This is OK for cwnd, but seems
<BR>
drastic for ssthresh.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it would be sensible for ssthresh to be set to 2*MSS
<BR>
after loss of the retransmitted segment (which happens after at least 1
<BR>
RTT), but not after timeout of the second segment in a sequence of
<BR>
segments that experience the same congestion.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If congestion is a state, then there are multiple events that
<BR>
correspond to being in that state (i.e. multiple timeouts).
<BR>
<P><P>Has this been investigated before (I'm still getting up to speed in this
<BR>
area)? If not, I think it might be worth doing so since unnecessary
<BR>
reduction of ssthresh can reduce throughput.
