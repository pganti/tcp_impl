<EM>&gt; Possible advantatges of delayed acks over ack filtering:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) There is not an innecessary transmission of acks (spending resources)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are going to be filtered at the router connected to the asymmetric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; link.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) If we consider that the dupacks are not delayed in the end system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there won't be problems with fast retransmit/fast recovery algorithms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which are triggered by 3 dupacks. The filtering of the dupacks at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; router may cause not to achieve the threshold of dupacks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Both algorithms cause sender burstiness. How do you solve that problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>A few of us at Berkeley (Hari Balakrishnan, Randy Katz and myself)
<BR>
investigated this problem and several solutions using a wireless cable 
<BR>
modem network from Hybrid, Inc. We considered ack filtering as
<BR>
well as a generalized version of delayed acks (which we called 
<BR>
&quot;ack congestion control&quot;). The idea was that ack congestion controlled
<BR>
could be triggered by RED-like marking of ack packets, which then
<BR>
gets reflected back to the receiver in later data packets.
<BR>
<P>We also considered the problem of source burstiness and designed a
<BR>
simple timer-based scheme to break up potentially large bursts into
<BR>
smaller ones. We have done an implementation of this is the BSD/OS 3.0
<BR>
kernel, and it works quite well.
<BR>
<P>In our investigations, we also found that the same techniques help
<BR>
improve performance in packet-radio networks such as the Ricochet
<BR>
network from Metricom, Inc.
<BR>
<P>These techniques techniques, together with simulation results, are
<BR>
described in our Mobicom '97 paper, which is available from:
