Hello,
<BR>
<P>The idea with the three duplicate ACKs of the fast retransmit algorithm
<BR>
is to eliminate any possibility for packet reordering. It is supposed
<BR>
that the receipt of three packets after the missing one is a good signal
<BR>
of the loss of this packet. So it is retransmitted without waiting for a
<BR>
timeout. Now, in New Reno, the first loss in a window required three
<BR>
duplicate ACKs, but once a partial ACK is received, the source can
<BR>
conclude directly that this packet is lost and it doesn't need the wait
<BR>
for any additional dup ACK, for this reason it doesn't change its dup
<BR>
ACKs counter. Why? because a partial ACK is sent most probably in
<BR>
response to the retransmission of the previous loss in the same window,
<BR>
so at least one Roundtrip time has passed since the first transmission
<BR>
of the missing packet. This roundtrip is enough to take a decision that
<BR>
the packet is lost. You can consider that the three dup ACKs counted at
<BR>
the begining of Fast Recovery is used by the source to fast retransmit
<BR>
any further loss in the same window.
<BR>
<P>Now for the value of the dup ACK counter at the end of fast Recovery, I
<BR>
think that here the value of this counter doesn't count a lot. Setting
<BR>
it to zero may prohibit the source from detecting some losses as you
<BR>
show in your exemple. Also taking the number of duplicate ACKs into
<BR>
account may cause a problem because we are not sure if these duplicate
<BR>
ACKs correspond to packets sent before or after the loss. A duplicate
<BR>
ACK for a packet sent before the missing packet is not a signal for the
<BR>
loss of this packet. I propose here to not count on the counter and
<BR>
instead to stretch the Fast Recovery phase to cover the new packets sent
<BR>
during Fast Recovery. Let X be the highest sequence number sent when the
<BR>
Fast Recovery phase is called, let Y be the highest sequence number sent
<BR>
when the last loss in the window is retransmitted. When an ACK for this
<BR>
loss is received, if this ACK askes for a packet less than Y than we can
<BR>
conclude that this packet is also lost without waiting for dup ACKs
<BR>
because at least one Roundtrip time has passed since its transmission.
<BR>
Now if the ACK carries a sequence number more than or equal to Y than
<BR>
dup ACK can be set to zero and normal Fast Retransmit can be used to
<BR>
detect the subsequent losses.
