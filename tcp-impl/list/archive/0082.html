<EM>&gt; Yes.  This bug showed up on our doorstep at Sun, and resolved it this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way a couple of years back.  If the receiver doesn't send back an ACK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of some kind to the zero window probe, after 8 minutes, we give up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most TCP's had it, since it was in the BSD base up until at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.4BSD, if my memory serves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I should've mentioned in my first message that the Solaris version
<BR>
that we tested that did not time out connections in zero window probe
<BR>
state was 2.3.  I just checked out Solaris 2.5.1, and it does exactly
<BR>
as Steve says; times out the connection in about 8 minutes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The spec isn't as clear about this as it could be, I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think so too.
<BR>
<P>When I sent my first message, I figured that the server must be in a
<BR>
probing state sending probes forever, even though they aren't acked.
<BR>
However, Josh's trace shows that the client is actually acking the
<BR>
probes, even though no one will ever read any of the data out of the
<BR>
closed window and open it again.  This is definitely very bad behavior
<BR>
on the part of the client, and ought to be fixed.
<BR>
