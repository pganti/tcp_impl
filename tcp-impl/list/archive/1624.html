<P>
I have the distinct impression that the consensus of this mailinglist
<BR>
is that:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- as much as possible, turning off the Nagle algorithm should be avoided.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one has reported any harm done to any network by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications that have set TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- an explicit flush mechanism might be useful, but it would be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functionally identical to how toggling TCP_NODELAY should work.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;- modifying the Nagle algorithm as proposed would not be profitable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ The proposal requires additional CPU cycles, code, and state in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every TCP implemetation, albeit not a lot.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ There are no existing applications or programs that would benefit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the change.  All existing programs that would benefit already
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set TCP_NODELAY, have not wrecked the Internet or even caused any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reported harm, and in most cases would stll be forced to set
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP_NODELAY and so could not benefit from the proposed change
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or avoid doing hypothetical harm to networks.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    applications.  However, for a certain class of applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (notably, request-response protocols) the Nagle algorithm interacts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    poorly with delayed acknowledgements to give these applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    poorer performance.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not quite right, is it?  Many request-response applications do
<BR>
not suffer any bad Nagle effects.  The canonical Nagle application, telnet,
<BR>
is a request-response protocol.  Its requests are keystrokes and the
<BR>
responses are echos.
<BR>
<P>Doesn't the class of applications are suffer from the Nagle algorithm
<BR>
consist of:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. poorly written applications that do send()-send()-receive()
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of writev()-receive().
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. applications that necessarily do send()-send() of small blocks.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. applications that send blocks larger than 1 MSS but not a multiple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the MSS on systems that do not block based on send() requests.
<BR>
<P>As far as I can see, only #3 might benefit from the proposal.  #1 and #2
<BR>
would still be forced to set TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;    This draft is NOT suggesting that these applications should disable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the Nagle algorithm.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not?  Exactly what is the harm done to the network or anything else
<BR>
when type #3 applications disable the Nagle algorithm?  The only harm I've
<BR>
heard mentioned can be best summarized as &quot;&quot;application writers are idiots
<BR>
and will write junk code that will trash the network if we give them the
<BR>
slightest opportunity.  Therefore, we must make the API so complicated and
<BR>
obscure so that only the smartest programmers will figure out how to do
<BR>
what they need to do.&quot;  I like the Nagle algorithm, but I am offended by
<BR>
some of the implicit attitudes offered in its defense.  Some programmers
<BR>
are idiots, but some others are not.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;    This draft suggests a fairly small and simple modification to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Nagle algorithm which preserves the Nagle algorithm as a means of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    protecting the internet while at the same time giving better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    performance to a wider class of applications.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The current Nagle algorithm can be described as follows:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	if ((packet.size &lt; Eff.snd.MSS) &amp;&amp; (snd.nxt &gt; snd.una)) {
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		do not send the packet;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	}
</EM><BR>
<P>My copy of 4.4BSD-Lite uses
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ((packet.size &lt; Eff.snd.MSS) &amp;&amp; (snd.nxt != snd.una)) {
<BR>
<P>That avoids hassles with computing (snd.nxt &gt; snd.una)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	if ((packet.size &lt; Eff.snd.MSS) &amp;&amp; (snd.sml &gt; snd.una)) {
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		do not send the packet;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	} else {
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		snd.sml = snd.nxt+packet.size;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		send the packet;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	}
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you have a favorite way of dealing with the problems behind computing 
<BR>
(snd.sml &gt; snd.una) ?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    To implement the modified Nagle algorithm in such a system, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    replace snd.sml with two variables: ``snd.sml.add'' is a TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Why modify the Nagle algorithm in such a system?  Exactly how do any of
<BR>
the &quot;certain class of applications&quot; benefit?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    explicit direction of the application.  For example, a system based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    on BSD might implement a socket option (using setsockopt(2))
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    SO_EXPLICITPUSH, as well as a flag to sendto(2) (possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    overloading the semantics of an existing flag, such as MSG_EOF).
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would any system put the SO_EXPLICITPUSH into setsockopt()?
<BR>
Or exactly what would be the difference in such a system between
<BR>
setting SO_EXPLICITPUSH and setting TCP_NODELAY?
<BR>
<P>And as we all seem to agree, note that turning TCP_NODELAY on and
<BR>
off around a send() request is or should be functionally identical
<BR>
to putting SO_EXPLICITPUSH in the send request.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;    In this scenario, an application would set a socket into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    SO_EXPLICITPUSH mode, then enter a mode of writing data to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    socket and, at the last write, using send(2) with the MSG_EOF flag.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The underlying TCP would recognize the MSG_EOF flag as an indicator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to transmit the (possibly) small packet.
</EM><BR>
<P>So SO_EXPLICITPUSH as a setsockopt() is not an action, but an
<BR>
enabler for MSG_EOF?  Why is an enabler needed?  Why not just honer
<BR>
MSG_EOF() (assuming you don't instead turn TCP_NODELAY on and off).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    If a system were to implement this interface, it would be important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to NOT disable Nagle when using this interface.  In other words,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    when using this interface, the default mode for TCP would be to NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    transmit a small packet (even in the presence of MSG_EOF) if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    previously transmitted small packet was as yet unacknowledged.
</EM><BR>
<P>If there were a packet stuck from a previous application of the Nagle
<BR>
algorithm, would you not want to push it out along with the new data that
<BR>
has been explicitly marked with MSG_EOF as needing to go out?  Why delay
<BR>
the new, urgent data because there is old, non-urgent data that is waiting?
<BR>
Regardless of what any RFC said, such behavior would generate plenty of
<BR>
bug reports.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Application scenarios that will not be helped by this modification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The proposed modification helps applications which do not need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    transmit more than one small packet in a single round-trip time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    This characterizes one way file transfer applications (such as FTP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    [RFC959]) and request/response protocols (such as NNTP [RFC977] and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    HTTP [RFC2068] without pipelining).
</EM><BR>
<P>In practice, that paragraph is false.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Doesn't the new NNTP include pipelining?  And what would be the harm
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should an NNTP implementation set TCP_NODELAY?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- When was the last time someone complained about FTP performance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effects of Nagle?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- since all HTTP implementations set TCP_NODELAY, modifcations to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nagle on their behalf are at best moot and irrelevant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    However, applications that need to transmit more than one small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    packet in a single round-trip time are not served by this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    modification.  An example of such an application is HTTP [RFC2068]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    using ``pipelining'', in which multiple requests (responses) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    transmitted asynchronously.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I last asked about concrete applications that would benefit from the
<BR>
proposal, only new HTTP was nominated, but seemed a better fit with
<BR>
a flush bit or TCP_NODELAY toggling.
