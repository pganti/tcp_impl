<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Im not arguing that der Mouse is doing the right thing in his circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But we can't make every random faulty piece of equipment an item to assess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; when evaluating the need for keepalives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It isn't a &quot;faulty piece of equipment&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well with RFC compliant keepalives his sessions get killed right ?
<BR>
<P>Yes - He said so
<BR>
<P>Therefore the firewall is buggy against the RFC's it should have been
<BR>
configured with respect to.
<BR>
<P>I cannot see how anyone can argue otherwise. Thats why its not relevant
<BR>
to the keepalive argument. a) its not RFC spec b) its fixable without
<BR>
breaking the rfc spec externally.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In the firewall case a firewall itself can (and should have) been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generating its own state checks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great, another piece of code to force people to write when it is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as easy to just leave the, what, dozen lines of code dealing with this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone?
</EM><BR>
<P>Suppose I have a firewall that doesnt do state checks by spoofing 
<BR>
keepalives internally. Now I sell it to 3ciscoscendnet  and their bright
<BR>
marketing people provide a nice windows configuration disk that sets the
<BR>
40,000 corporate windows PC's to use 5 minute keepalives. Now sell those
<BR>
to every major corporation.
<BR>
<P>Fixing the firewall would have been the right thing to do - obviously. And
<BR>
furthermore as my initial comment showed you can fix that without changes
<BR>
to the client PC's by spoofing keepalives and stealing the ack in the firewall
<BR>
itself [sure der mouse can't in this case but on that issue he is [pardon the
<BR>
insult] a user.
<BR>
<P>This is completely seperate to the issue of &quot;are keepalives good or bad&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Is 2hrs now overlong as a limit&quot; &quot;should we standardise knobs for setting
<BR>
it&quot;. All Im pointing out is that said misimplemented firewall is not relevant
<BR>
to the discussion. It is broken. Vern's http server resource point is relevant
<BR>
as are his comments on packet size. And those are worth listening to.
<BR>
<P>Now I'll buy a lot of Vern's arguments for shorter keepalives due to resource
<BR>
issues and the fact a protocol keepalive is no less resource using.
<BR>
