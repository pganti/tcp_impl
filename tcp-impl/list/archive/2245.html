<P>
When we discussed this today, it was decided to consider an instrumentation
<BR>
option for TCP. One of the instrumentation values would be a code (or codes)
<BR>
for the cause of a RST. Implementations are thus still free to do what they
<BR>
do today (such as placing a text message in the data portion); however, that
<BR>
is only useful for packet tracing and is not available or useable by an
<BR>
application. Note that an API interface (for BSD sockets for example) was
<BR>
not really discussed for the instrumentation option and might be an issue to
<BR>
consider.
<BR>
<P>Likely, an option would be sent in a SYN to advertise the ability to support
<BR>
the instrumentation option. Lack of a reply with a similar option in the
<BR>
SYN/ACK would mean that the peer does not support the option and hence it
<BR>
would not be used. (This is similar to how other options, such as SACK,
<BR>
work.)
<BR>
<P>Don't flame this approach yet as it is still in the process of being
<BR>
developed. Also, my brief description above likely has not done it justice.

Subject: Re: keep RST data nonstandardized for the future!
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; I've actually written 75% of this draft and included Jerry's codes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that he helpfully sent me three years ago!  Also as far as I am aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mentat is the ONLY TCP stack in wide circulation to use these codes.
</EM><BR>
<P>ONLY has no relevance to WIDE; it's the ONLY or it's not.
<BR>
<P>The problem with data in the stream is multi-dimensional. First of all,
<BR>
the specs let anybody do anything, and I guarantee that somebody is
<BR>
doing something that won't be appreciated. It is highly likely that
<BR>
there are at least a few implementations which (1) use some format you
<BR>
do not, (2) leave binary data as leftovers in the RST, or (3) will do
<BR>
something else in the future since the spec allows it.
<BR>
<P>If we are going to standardize on the interpretation of errors, then the
<BR>
representation should be standardized in such a way that interpretation
<BR>
is not likely. Reverse-standardizing on legacy representations does not
<BR>
satisfy that objective. In other words, if we find out that in some
<BR>
particular scenario there are many stacks which leave binary junk in the
<BR>
data stream for RST then your spec will be instantly broken.
<BR>
<P>To wit:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I followed the FTP/SMTP code / string idea in the draft as Rick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested
</EM><BR>
<P>That will make legacy Mentat implementations non-compliant, and will
<BR>
require coding around.
<BR>
<P>The primary benefit of an RST option is that the representation of the
<BR>
failure is removed from the datastream, guaranteeing that the only
<BR>
implementations who do anything with it are the implementations who know
<BR>
WHAT to do with it explicitly.
<BR>
<P>A secondary benefit is that TEXT data is not required, but instead there
<BR>
is room for explicit codes/types in 2 bytes of option data (four bytes
<BR>
if you include all the option overhead which isn't necessary with
<BR>
options that are not variable-length).
<BR>
<P>Trying to do this in the free-form datastream is a bad idea all around,
<BR>
I believe.
