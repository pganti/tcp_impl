<P>
Well, it isn't difficult to deal with the backwards compatibility issue
<BR>
PROVIDED none of these messages start with a numeric value. If the n-digit
<BR>
code followed by the delimiter is not present, assume the entire message is
<BR>
text.
<BR>
<P>Using a TCP option is certainly an alternative.
<BR>
<P>Note that this data is intended for the RECEIVER of the RST. That end of the
<BR>
connection will typically still be attached to an application. It would
<BR>
require a new API call or other means to obtain the message and also
<BR>
changing the applications to call this new API. So, most applications
<BR>
already written would not get this information unless modified. Perhaps a
<BR>
'getsockopt' call of SO_RSTMSGTXT and SO_RSTMSGNUM or some such codes could
<BR>
be used.

<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Perhaps an FTP/SMTP/... like response format would be useful - &lt;n&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; digit code followed by a delimiter (space) followed by human readable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; text. That way, TCP itself and/or application can decode the numeric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code and understand it and the application could also display the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; returned message for the human to read.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's pretty unlikely that applications will get the text if TCP
<BR>
is burning down the connection. Another problem with reverse
<BR>
standardization around data in the stream is that not everbody who does
<BR>
it already will be compliant with whatever approach is finished.
<BR>
<P>Getting explicit errors out of the data stream seems like the best way
<BR>
to go if there's real interest in this. Maybe a TCP option would be a
<BR>
better way to handle a standardized format (as opposed to the legacy ad
<BR>
hoc approach), since that would allow for explicit codes, types and
<BR>
text, the latter of which could be explicitly passed to the application.
<BR>
Another benefit of using an option is that it would be ignored by legacy
<BR>
implementations as a matter of course.
