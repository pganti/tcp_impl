<P>
Hi,
<BR>
<P>I've a question regarding your draft (draft-ietf-tcpimpl-newreno-02):
<BR>
<P>I believe that the NewReno draft/RFC should be more specific about the
<BR>
handling of the duplicate ACKs counter (dupacks) in step 5.
<BR>
<P>For both partial and full ACKs, I propose that dupacks should be
<BR>
decremented by the number of segments acknowledged minus one. This is
<BR>
similar to the draft's recommendation for updating cwnd upon receiving
<BR>
a partial ACK. The proposed change will only affect the retransmissions
<BR>
of segments 'around' the right edge of the window, i.e., segments with
<BR>
sequence numbers 'around' recover.
<BR>
<P>The draft is unclear about dupacks handling when a partial ACK is
<BR>
received. If dupacks is left unchanged upon receiving a partial ACK,
<BR>
unnecessary transmissions may occur (see Example 1). Instead,
<BR>
decrementing dupacks, as I propose, delays the retransmission of
<BR>
a segment until there is enough evidence that three segments sent
<BR>
after it were received (see Examples 1 and 2).
<BR>
<P>The draft recommends dupacks to be reset upon receiving a full ACK.
<BR>
Example 3 shows how resetting dupacks prevents a useful retransmision to
<BR>
happen. In addition, Example 3 shows how information useful for segment
<BR>
retransmission is preserved upon exiting fast recovery if dupacks
<BR>
is updated as I propose.
<BR>
<P>I've checked the tcp-impl archive and didn't find any discussion on
<BR>
this issue. If this has already been discussed in the WG, please let
<BR>
me know.
<BR>
<P>Looking forward to your comments.
<BR>
Regards,
<BR>
Marcel
<BR>
<P><P>The partial ACK case is described first, followed by the full ACK
<BR>
case. I'll assume that ACK messages are never lost. Lost ACKs will
<BR>
only make the proposed scheme more conservative...
<BR>
<P>A. The partial ACKs case:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From draft-ietf-tcpimpl-newreno, February 1999, page 4, step 5:
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this ACK does *not* acknowledge all of the data up to and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including &quot;recover&quot;, then this is a partial ACK.  In this case,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmit the first unacknowledged segment.  Deflate the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion window by the amount of new data acknowledged, then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add back one MSS and send a new segment if permitted by the new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value of cwnd.  This &quot;partial window deflation&quot; attempts to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that, when Fast Recovery eventually ends, approximately
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ssthresh amount of data will be outstanding in the network.
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;&gt; Do not clear the counter recording the number of duplicate
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledgements (i.e., do not exit the Fast Recovery procedure).&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Should we understand that dupacks should not be changed upon receiving
<BR>
a partial ACK?  If this is the case, the next example shows a situation
<BR>
in which the draft recommends retransmitting a segment too early.
<BR>
<P>Example 1.
<BR>
Consider the following sequence of eight segments, with an initial
<BR>
congestion window (cwnd) of 8.  The 1st and the 7th segment in the
<BR>
sequence are lost:
<BR>
[1] 2 3 4 5 6 [7] 8    ([ ] =  lost segments)
<BR>
<P>After sending segments 1-8, the source receives three duplicate acks,
<BR>
and it retransmits segment 1. Immediately before receiving the partial
<BR>
ACK, which acknowledges segment 6, cwnd is 10 = 4 (initial cwnd = 8/2) +
<BR>
6 (duplicate ACKs generated by segments 2-6, 8).
<BR>
<P>When the partial ack arrives, dupacks is 6 and the draft says only
<BR>
that it shouldn't be reset.  As dupacks &gt;= 3, should segment 7 be
<BR>
retransmitted immediately?
<BR>
<P>Since only two segments sent after 7 (segment 8 and the retransmission
<BR>
of 1) were acked by the destination, it is probably too early to
<BR>
retransmit segment 7.
<BR>
<P>I believe that, upon receiving a partial ACK, the sender should
<BR>
decrement dupacks by the number of segments acknowledged minus one.
<BR>
In this example, the resulting dupacks is 1. If we want to be more
<BR>
aggressive and count the retransmission of segment 1 as a segment sent
<BR>
after 7 but acked before 7, then the new value of dupacks should be 2.
<BR>
Either way, I don't think that segment 7 shouldn't be retransmitted
<BR>
at this time.
<BR>
<P>According to the draft, upon receiving the partial ack, cwnd is
<BR>
deflated by 6 (the amount of data acknowledged) and inflated by 1. The
<BR>
new congestion window is 5 (10 - 6 + 1). Based on the new value of
<BR>
cwnd, the source will sends three new segments. It is probably closer
<BR>
to the spirit of the &quot;Fast Retransmit&quot; algorithm to retransmit segment
<BR>
7 only after (if ever) two acks (or one ack if we count the retransmission
<BR>
of 1) for segment 6 are received. Alternatively, if an ACK for segments
<BR>
7, 8, 9, or 10 is received before dupacks becomes 3, the proposed rule
<BR>
for updating dupacks eliminates an unnecessary retransmission.
<BR>
<P>The next example shows that the proposed rule for updating the dupacks
<BR>
counter doesn't prevent partial ACKs from generating retransmissions.
<BR>
<P>Example 2.
<BR>
Consider an initial cwnd of 10, message 1 and 7 are lost, messages
<BR>
2-6, 8-10 are received. If dupacks is decremented upon receiving a partial
<BR>
ack (for segment 6), then dupacks is updated to 8 - 5 = 3. You can think
<BR>
of the new value of dupacks as representing the three duplicate ACKs
<BR>
generated by the receipt of segments 8, 9, and 10. As the new value
<BR>
of dupacks is &gt;= 3, segment 7 is retransmitted immediately.
<BR>
<P>B. The full ACK case:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From draft-ietf-tcpimpl-newreno, February 1999, page 4, step 5:
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this ACK acknowledges all of the data up to and including
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;recover&quot;, then the ACK acknowledges all the intermediate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segments sent between the original transmission of the lost
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segment and the receipt of the third duplicate ACK.  Set cwnd to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either (1) min (ssthresh, FlightSize + MSS); or (2) ssthresh,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where ssthresh is the value set in step 1; this is termed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;deflating&quot; the window.  (We note that &quot;FlightSize&quot; in step 1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;referred to the amount of data outstanding in step 1, when Fast
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovery was entered, while &quot;FlightSize&quot; in step 5 refers to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount of data outstanding in step 5, when Fast Recovery is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exited.) If the second option is selected, the implementation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should take measures to avoid a possible burst of data, in case
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the amount of data outstanding in the network was much less than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new congestion window allows [HTH98].  &gt;&gt; Clear the counter
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recording the number of duplicate acknowledgements, exiting the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast Recovery procedure. &lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P><P>Example 3.
<BR>
Consider an initial cwnd of 9, message 1 and 7 are lost, messages 2-6,
<BR>
8, and 9 are received. recover is set to 9 and ssthresh to 4. If we update
<BR>
dupacks as in example 1, upon receiving a partial ack for segment 6,
<BR>
segment 7 is not retransmitted immediately because the new value of
<BR>
dupacks is 2. However, the new cwnd is 6 and three new  data segments
<BR>
(10, 11, 12) are sent. Lets assume segment 10 is dropped:
<BR>
[1] 2 3 4 5 6 [7] 8 9 [10] 11 12 13   ([ ] = lost segments)
<BR>
<P>The sender receives two additional ACKs for segment 6 (dupacks == 4),
<BR>
retransmits 7, and gets an ACK for segment 9. As recover is 9, this last
<BR>
ACK is a full ACK.
<BR>
<P>According to the draft, upon receiving a full ACK, the source sets
<BR>
dupacks to zero. In addition, the source sets cwnd to ssthresh (= 4)
<BR>
and it sends a new data segment, 13. The receipt of segment 13 generates
<BR>
a second ACK for segment 9 and dupacks is incremented from 0 to 1.
<BR>
<P>Clearing dupacks erases all the information the source has recorded
<BR>
on segments 10, 11, and 12. Ideally, dupacks should be reset to 2
<BR>
in order to count for segments 11 and 12.
<BR>
<P>If we apply the proposed rule for updating dupacks and decrement it
<BR>
by the number of segments acknowledged minus one, the resulting value
<BR>
is 2 (= 4 - 2).  After the second ACK for 9 is received (the ACK generated
<BR>
by segment 13), segment 10 can be retransmitted.
<BR>
<P>Please correct me if I am wrong.
