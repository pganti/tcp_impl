<P><EM>&gt; I would rather see the &quot;receiving TCP&quot; open the window when it detects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this case and resetting the connection if any new data was received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (even if that data was received because of a window probe). I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is what BSD based stacks typically do. I don't see any advantage to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waiting for a probe before opening the window (and discarding the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previously received data).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, new data should cause an RST to be generated, but there is no
<BR>
need to require that the window be opened.  A window probe *is* new
<BR>
data, it just happens to be one byte beyond the end of the current
<BR>
window.  BSD stacks generate a RST when receiving a window probe for
<BR>
a connection that the user has closed.  (It trims any old data off
<BR>
the front of the packet, checks for new data for a closed connection
<BR>
and generates a RST if there is any, and then it trims any data off
<BR>
the end of the packet beyond the edge of the window.)
<BR>
<P>I'd say that real problem in the cited examples is that the sending
<BR>
host is not correctly generating window probes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;       Note: The persistence probes done by Machine A are the older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       style (resending the last octet to solicit an ACK).
</EM><BR>
<P>RFC 793 is not clear that you should generate a RST when receiving data
<BR>
for a closed connection when all the new data is beyond the end of the
<BR>
window. From page 69:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the RCV.WND is zero, no segments will be acceptable, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;special allowance should be made to accept valid ACKs, URGs and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSTs.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an incoming segment is not acceptable, an acknowledgment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be sent in reply (unless the RST bit is set, if so drop
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the segment and return):
<BR>
<P>But in RFC 1122, page 88, it states:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A host MAY implement a &quot;half-duplex&quot; TCP close sequence, so
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that an application that has called CLOSE cannot continue to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read data from the connection.  If such a host issues a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOSE call while received data is still pending in TCP, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if new data is received after CLOSE is called, its TCP 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD send a RST to show that data was lost.
<BR>
<P>So that seems to clarify it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only other option that may make sense to discuss is whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;receiving TCP&quot; just resets the connection when there is data on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receive queue when the application &quot;closes&quot; the socket (in such a way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it can no longer read that data). I don't a strong opinion on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether this is better (we could argue that it isn't because most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementations open the window and reset if more data is received).
</EM><BR>
<P>According to the preceeding quote from RFC 1122, it is already
<BR>
documented that a host should generate a RST in this case.  I'm
<BR>
not sure if BSD does this (generate a RST when the connection is
<BR>
closed with un-read data), from a brief look at the code I can't
<BR>
quickly confirm this one way or the other.
<BR>
