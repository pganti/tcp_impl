<P>
In regards to all the simulations and suggestions and such, I have a
<BR>
question.
<BR>
<P>How many systems on the Internet today strictly adhere to the IW=1? 
<BR>
<P>I ask because I wonder if we are already gaining operational experience
<BR>
with the Internet proper with an IW that is effectively 2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From everything I have heard, it sounds like the strict adherents are
</EM><BR>
mostly Solaris 2.something systems. From the dust-up over the IW between
<BR>
Win95/NT and Solaris, I gather that Win95/NT have an effective IW of 2. 
<BR>
<P>I know that HP-UX has an effective IW of 2, and I would guess (with no
<BR>
hard data) that most other commercial Unix offerings have that as well
<BR>
or we would have also heard of performance interoperability issues
<BR>
between Win95/NT and those Unixes. I'll not hazard a guess for FreeBSD
<BR>
and Linux.
<BR>
<P>I guess a followup question would be what proportion of the &quot;Internet
<BR>
traffic mass&quot; is comprised of &quot;ants&quot; (Win95 et al) versus &quot;mamals&quot; (the
<BR>
Unixes).
