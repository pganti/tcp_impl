<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that there isn't really a required correlation between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; send() calls and segments, regardless of NODELAY (or anything else I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; can find, excepting _only_ the proposed flush bit, which might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; defined as guaranteeing that the last byte of the write is the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; byte of a segment).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That sides steps my intended question.  As with previous rounds in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion of the Nagle algorithm, what we think is a correct exegesis of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the (or a) standard is basically irrelevant.  Does it matter whether RFC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 896 talked about send() system calls, passages through tcp_output(), or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cycles of the RFC 793 state machine?  NO!--What really matters is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens in representative, currently deployed implementations.  First
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure out the problem, and after that choose an architecture, a layering,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a religion.  That order is what made TCP, and the opposite is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made TP0-TP4/CONS-CLNS.
</EM><BR>
<P>AOK - stated differently, current implementations do not guarantee
<BR>
any correlation between send() calls and segments.  There are more
<BR>
deployed implementations than just BSD. It makes more sense, as Sally Floyd
<BR>
has said in other threads, to keep the requirements as open and flexible
<BR>
as possible. We might be better less concerned with &quot;what would 
<BR>
OS X.Y.Z do with this mod&quot; than &quot;what's the best and worst a 'compliant' 
<BR>
system could do, given these requiremetns&quot;.

<EM>&gt; ] &gt; &gt; TCP currently lacks a few things that would certainly be useful to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; &gt; applications that want something other than a byte-stream, [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; Um, yeah.  I'm not quite sure what your point is.  This sounds like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; &quot;TCP isn't all things to all applications&quot;, which doesn't really sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; to me like something that is possible to fix, nor do I think it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] &gt; be desirable to try.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was horrified by some of the ideas.  EOF and record markers particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bother me because they are so trivially implemented by the application
</EM><BR>
<P>Reliability is also trivially implemented at the app layer, but TCP/IP
<BR>
is preferred to TCP/UDP/IP. Some things are more effectively, efficiently,
<BR>
or consistently implemented in the transport layer. Granted, it's open
<BR>
to debate what that list is; I was giving examples, not requirements.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the third hand, was in it this mailinglist where Joe Touch and others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tonight mentioned Gbit/sec TCP for clusters?  Every minor optional feature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you add to a protocol hurts enormously at the boundaries, on very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large and fast and on very small systems. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not always - some can be disabled (such as disabling windowing for
<BR>
connections on the same subnet), others do not come into play unless
<BR>
triggered (e.g., some of the markings proposed could be implemented
<BR>
in options; there's only one check to see if there are &quot;no options&quot;, and
<BR>
it has to be performed anyway).
