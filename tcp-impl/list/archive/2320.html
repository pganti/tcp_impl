<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Some that I could think of are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;- No listener (for a SYN segment)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;- Unknown connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;- Receiver discard connection (data received on a connection with no higher

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;level receiver available)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;- Application abort (application requested RST on connection instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;closing it)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm sure that your reasons are well-meant and quite honest, but I have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; wonder out loud if these codes won't be of great help to a hacker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Only if they're trying to hack your statistics or debugging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't think (pls correct me if this is not the case) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anyone is proposing different receiver actions based on these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;codes; it's just for diagnoses, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any information shot back to the sender of a SYN is potential information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a hacker. For example, if the code says something like &quot;too busy&quot; (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that might indicate that), then Joe Hacker knows that your server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is on the brink: just keep pumping SYNs until it keels over. If it says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like &quot;bad security&quot; or &quot;bad precedence&quot;, well, you are just asking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. &quot;too busy&quot; is a foolish place to send a RST, however. 
<BR>
<P>The message needs to have meaning in the TCP-sense; bad precedence means
<BR>
something, but bad security doesn't (that message would come in other
<BR>
layers, or not at all. why would you tell someone about that?).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All I say is &quot;let's be careful&quot;. The less information you provide back to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potentially malicious instigator, the lesser the chances that it will know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to affect you worst.
</EM><BR>
<P>The primary purpose I saw was to send &quot;where in the TCP stack the RST
<BR>
came from&quot;. I wouldn't suggest 'different application reasons'; it seems
<BR>
to me TCP's job is over once you tell be why _TCP_ did something.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In fact, I would almost argue that an RST in response to a SYN or SYN/ACK should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not contain any information whatsoever (unless a kernel flag was turned on) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minimize this potential. I have no problem with info on RSTs which are sent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elsewhere in the cycle, ie, from established onwards.
</EM><BR>
<P>It could say &quot;SYN rejected&quot;, or &quot;SYN/ACK rejected&quot;. There are different
<BR>
reasons for the SYN/ACK rejection, including precedence. But that
<BR>
doesn't seem like information that's particularly useful. Either _you_
<BR>
changed the precedence (in which case this is helpful) or a hacker did
<BR>
(in which case they can change the RST anyway).
<BR>
<P>This is the reason I caution about _USE_ of the information, e.g., used
<BR>
for diagnostics only.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I'm saying is that you only want to turn them on when you are actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debugging something. Until then, leave them off. There is no need to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extra tools to the intruders out there.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it's turned off by default, it may be impossible to debug. I don't
<BR>
always have control over both ends.
