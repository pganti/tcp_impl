<EM>&gt; It is going to be far better that we have tools, even partially useful ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than getting them from other sources.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you mean the most preferable way of characterizing an implementation problem
<BR>
is with a tool that detects it, I fully agree (I'm not sure exactly what you
<BR>
meant by &quot;than getting them from other sources&quot;).  I'm just saying that we
<BR>
also need to consider that sometimes the tools will not be available, and
<BR>
I think it's still useful to talk about implementation problems in the
<BR>
absence of a diagnostic tool.  Hopefully this will be rare.  One idea is
<BR>
to acknowledge a range of ways to characterize problems: a diagnostic tool
<BR>
is best, a description of how to reliably reproduce the problem is okay, and
<BR>
evidence such as a packet trace is still useful, though not as greatly as the
<BR>
others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I get most of my network test tools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from either phrack types or firewalls folk.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are classes of implementation problems such as security ones for which
<BR>
diagnostic tools are often already available.  There are other classes such
<BR>
as congestion behavior for which devising such tools is a lot harder.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The current policy appears to sit on a problem and pray like crazy it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get out. That IMHO has never been an acceptable policy ...
</EM><BR>
<P>It's crucial to keep in mind that the working group will be most successful
<BR>
by including as large a group of implementors as possible.  You might well
<BR>
argue that the policies of some of the implementors for reporting security
<BR>
problems is misguided, but I think for purposes of the working group these
<BR>
policies need to be recognized.  I'd be surprised if an implementor would
<BR>
choose to change their policy in order to participate in the group, rather
<BR>
than deciding the group isn't useful because joining it would require
<BR>
changing their policy.
<BR>
<P>Security issues raise enough hard problems that I wonder whether security
<BR>
shouldn't have its own effort, either as a subgroup within the implementor
<BR>
WG, or as its own WG.
