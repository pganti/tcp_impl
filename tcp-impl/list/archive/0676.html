<P>
<EM>&gt; &quot;not presently the case&quot; argues against any bug fix.
</EM><BR>
<P>No - &quot;not presently the case, and significant, and we're not chartered
<BR>
to make changes other than minor refinements&quot; argues against the bug fix.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe the forward path should be degraded by conditions along the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reverse. Maybe it already is ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, maybe - research question, how the window-state approach alters TCP
<BR>
dynamics and throughput from its current behavior.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;tricks&quot; that lose ack clocks cause source bursts, and maybe they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be 'punished'. That doesn't seem inconsistent either.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe they should - my point was that standardizing on the window-state
<BR>
approach will be more contentious than the idle-time approach.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My point is that either approach is 'different' than what is currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how the idle-time approach is significantly different from
<BR>
what is (supposed) to be already done.  Certainly not to the same degree
<BR>
as switching to a window-state approach.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The correct fix is to precisely define 'loss of ack clock'.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the correct fix for TCP-ng; and maybe also for a subsequent TCP
<BR>
revision.  But not for tcp-impl, in which our job is to stick as close
<BR>
to current practice/standards as feasible.
<BR>
