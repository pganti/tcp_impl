<EM>&gt; A zero length segment can not be reliably delivered by TCP since it can not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be acknowledged.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe t_force in BSD allows TCP to send one byte i.e. it might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send the urgent byte but it will at least send a segment that contains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the urgent pointer. This allows the reliable delivery of an urgent notification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the other application.
</EM><BR>
<P>Erik:
<BR>
<P>Thank you...  That's a very good point.  I withdraw the suggestion...
<BR>
The point I was trying to make was that immediate visibility of the URG
<BR>
flag at the receiver is crucial.  As you note, an application could deadlock
<BR>
if this does not happen.  Therefore, it is important that the flag get delivered
<BR>
reliably, which will only be true if some data is sent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would it be useful to nail down this detailed behavior?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think so.  It may seem obvious that a sender should force a segment
<BR>
onto the wire when entering urgent mode, but is it obvious that only a single
<BR>
segment should be forced?  Suppose I note that I can force all the data through
<BR>
the urgent point onto the wire, because I have enough window, and I don't
<BR>
feel like it is so bad to exceed the congestion window by a few MSS because
<BR>
the data is really *urgent* and I want to do the application a favor and
<BR>
get it all delivered quickly...  This would be bad.  I would prefer to say
<BR>
that the sender should not override any send rules when entering urgent mode,
<BR>
but a zero-length segment won't get the job done (reliably).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A lot of the behavior is tied to the socket API and not to the TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocol specification.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes...  Most of the difficulty that I see with TCP urgent data is as a result
<BR>
of applications which are not really portable from one sockets implementation
<BR>
to another.  Artifacts of the implementation are believed to be guarantees,
<BR>
but don't carry over from one system to another.  That's a whole can of worms
<BR>
that can't be sorted out here!
