Hi,

<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was going through the paper &quot;A Dynamic Network Architecture&quot; by Sean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; O'Malley and Larry Peterson. In this paper they introduce a dynamic network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arch. in which the number of layers visited by each message/packet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find this a very interesting idea. What do you all say ?? Has any further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work been done on this??
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe that there's been quite a lot of further work done by the
<BR>
(same?) team at the University of Arizona (I've got quite a few of their
<BR>
papers in front of me). 
<BR>
<P>Having recently read their papers I've found that the system I've been
<BR>
building for embedded networking (initially for 8 bit systems) is very
<BR>
similar.  It's a very good concept for building systems when resources
<BR>
are tight (my main target has 128 kBytes of flash for code and 32 kBytes
<BR>
of SRAM for data).
<BR>
<P>Please note that the following comments are entirely based on my
<BR>
experience (with my own code) with such small systems and I'm not sure
<BR>
how well the implementation scales (although I should know fairly soon
<BR>
as the code's being ported to the i386 now).  It's also worth noting
<BR>
that the OS hosting this stack supports very fine grained priority
<BR>
handling (it's an RTOS), and this does have an impact...
<BR>
<P>I'll start with the obvious downside: inter-layer transitions cost
<BR>
time.  There is an upside that helps compensate this to an extent:
<BR>
binding only those elements that are necessary avoids and wasted
<BR>
conditional code sequences.  The net effect is, however, negative.
<BR>
<P>The number of threads required for its use is not dependent on the
<BR>
number of services being handled.  In a trivial case, 1 thread per
<BR>
datalink device is sufficient as the threads simply push packets through
<BR>
the stack all the way to the end-application.  It looks like on higher
<BR>
performance systems the thread count could be weighted, giving more
<BR>
threads to faster devices.  By having a thread per message and avoiding
<BR>
context switching is a big win - in my own case this far outweighs the
<BR>
losses due to inter-layer transitions (very conservatively this is about
<BR>
a 10:1 ratio).
<BR>
<P>By dynamically binding the layers at run-time, the linker can remove any
<BR>
layers that can never be referenced (huge win for small systems) without
<BR>
resorting to a lot of conditional compilation.  An example here is that
<BR>
a device doesn't have to carry any SLIP-support code if running purely
<BR>
on Ethernet, or conversely I don't carry any of the ARP, Ethernet
<BR>
framing, etc, when only using SLIP. The downside is that there is some
<BR>
additional overhead to manage the dynamically bound layers.  Dynamic
<BR>
binding makes it easy to insert things such as packet filters so this
<BR>
can be a run-time decision, but with no cost if the filter is not bound.
<BR>
<P>The fine-grained layers make it easier to separate policy and mechanism
<BR>
- in my code, when a listening TCP port, receives a SYN, the service
<BR>
bound to the port is upcalled and can decide whether or not to accept or
<BR>
decline the connection.  More generally in the TCP case this means that
<BR>
there are no resources being consumed by the stack without the agreement
<BR>
of the applications (or at least the upper layers).
<BR>
<P>Avoiding context switching means that a lot of queuing can be avoided
<BR>
too.  An earlier evolution of my stack was far more conventional and
<BR>
used to have threads in the IP layer and each application service as
<BR>
well as in the device drivers.  It was fairly trivial to crash the whole
<BR>
system with buffer overflows (only 32k SRAM in the system) - flood
<BR>
pinging would take almost no time to do this.  I originally added buffer
<BR>
management and this simply resulted in no crashes but no work being done
<BR>
either (total DoS)!  The new stack degrades gracefully - if I have a
<BR>
debug compiled version of the code (does lots of sanity checks) a flood
<BR>
ping may result in a 30% response rate, whilst a full-speed version
<BR>
might yield a 45% response.
<BR>
<P>I was just about to note that one downside with this style of system is
<BR>
that it doesn't support BSD sockets (to support existing code), but of
<BR>
course these can be implemented as (almost) trivial layers on top the
<BR>
&quot;native&quot; code.
<BR>
<P>One other nice feature of this style of system is that it makes it easy
<BR>
to develop.  By dynamically binding each of the layers, it's extremely
<BR>
easy to change one of them.  My main plan when I start to look at some
<BR>
of the higher-performance TCP extensions will be to retain my existing
<BR>
(slow but working) TCP code bound to my SLIP link for my debugging
<BR>
services whilst binding the newer (faster but, initially at least,
<BR>
probably not-working) TCP code to the Ethernet link.
<BR>
<P>Sorry if this is a bit rambling, but it's about the first time I've
<BR>
tried to explain what I've been doing and I might have got a bit carried
<BR>
away :-)
