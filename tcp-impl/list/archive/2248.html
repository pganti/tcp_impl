A few observations:
<BR>
<P>- We've had this feature in the field for most of a decade.  It has been
<BR>
occasionally helpful and I'm not aware of it ever causing a problem.  (There
<BR>
was one printer which somehow accepted the strings as data and added them
<BR>
to the last page, but complaints, if any, never got back to us ;-).
<BR>
<P>- We have always provided a switch to turn off the feature, but I am not aware
<BR>
of it ever being used.  The default has always been &quot;on&quot;.
<BR>
<P>- We would be happy to clean up using a code/text format.  As I noted, our
<BR>
current strings are not uniformly attractive nor comprehensible.
<BR>
<P>- The suggested set of messages would, of course, have to be extendable.  Some
<BR>
of ours are very implementation specific and would be meaningless in a general
<BR>
specification.
<BR>
<P>- I can't imagine how the information would give a hacker anything that they
<BR>
don't already have.
