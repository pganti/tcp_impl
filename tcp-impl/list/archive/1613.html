<P>
I think you've outlined the issues very well. Here are a few comments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The basic issue at hand is that the past performance of the network is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being used to predict the future. It is recognized that the longer the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interval between past input and the current decision time is, the less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reliable that data is for making the decision. However, traditional
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not convinced that there is a strong correlation between the
<BR>
length of the idle period and the reliability of old congestion
<BR>
information. Consider a bottleneck link that is shared by multiple
<BR>
connections. If one of them becomes idle, the others would soon
<BR>
(within several RTTs) ramp up and consume the bandwidth that the
<BR>
idle connection freed up. If the idle connection were to restart
<BR>
after this time and immediately start sending at its old rate, it
<BR>
may cause overload and packet loss. (This is even assuming that 
<BR>
packets are sent out smoothly.) So the appropriateness of having
<BR>
an idle connection restart without slow start dissipates within 
<BR>
(at most) several RTTs, a duration which is likely to be a much 
<BR>
shorter than the typical user &quot;think time&quot; in a Web browsing session.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; So for the sake of clarity, I want to remove the concept of burst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control from the discussion of restart algorithms. Perhaps a 'burst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window' or other such technique can be orthogonally implemented to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address the issue (something that would learn in a similar fashion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the maximum allowable network burst would be).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I couldn't agree with you more! Avoiding bursts, be it via timers,
<BR>
&quot;burst windows&quot;, etc., is the easy part. The hard part is figuring
<BR>
out what the congestion window and other variables should be set
<BR>
to after an idle period.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Moving back to idle algorithms I would like to experiment with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something adaptive.. maybe a cwnd reduction of 20% (min 1 segment) for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every A-4D elapsed in the idle period (apply in a compounding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion).. This reverses the impact of the variance mentioned above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while providing more fine grained input into the 'trust' process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be worth investigating, but as I have outlined above, I
<BR>
don't intuitively understand why a gradual decay of the congestion
<BR>
window (over the timescale of interest -- 10s of seconds) would be
<BR>
appropriate. Given the current congestion window size, should we be
<BR>
more confident in estimating the appropriate window size after a
<BR>
1-minute idle period compared to a 2-minute idle period?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While I intend to go ahead in looking at this, I'm soliciting any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helpful insights or 'been there done that' comments folks may have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The approach I took in my work on &quot;TCP Fast Start&quot; was to have an 
<BR>
explicit protocol mechanism to &quot;hedge&quot; any bets (guesses) we may 
<BR>
make about the appropriate window size after an idle period. With 
<BR>
such a mechanism in place, it may be okay to err on the side of being 
<BR>
too aggressive (i.e., using a larger window size than appropriate). 
<BR>
The mechanism I used was priority dropping -- i.e., packets sent 
<BR>
when the sender is unsure of the appropriateness of congestion window
<BR>
size are assigned a low drop priority. This would shield (to an extent)
<BR>
other traffic in the event of the guess being incorrect. While
<BR>
priority dropping is a simple mechanism and similar in spirit to
<BR>
some of the diffserv mechanisms being considered, the Internet is
<BR>
not quite ready for it yet. More information on this work is available
<BR>

<BR>
<P>One final note: I believe the deployment of RED in routers would
<BR>
improve the chances of success for a fast start like scheme, because
<BR>
the router buffers would better be able to absorb the surge in
<BR>
load due to connections that are restarting.
