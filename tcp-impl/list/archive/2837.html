<P>I'm not sure that we encourage reordering &quot;as a frequent matter of course&quot; 
<BR>
now. Many routers have the option of distributing traffic round-robin on a 
<BR>
multi-path route, but most that I am aware of default to sending any 
<BR>
specific microflow along a specific sub-path of that route, by such 
<BR>
techniques as hashing the flow signature (source/destination address and 
<BR>
perhaps more) and using the hash to deterministically select a route. The 
<BR>
other behaviors that can cause reordering, such as changing routes, happen 
<BR>
infrequently and are presumably necessary to implement a routing policy or 
<BR>
avoid something worse, such as not having a route that works.
<BR>
<P>What I understood the original request to be was &quot;eliminate reordering&quot;. 
<BR>
That is what I have been addressing.
