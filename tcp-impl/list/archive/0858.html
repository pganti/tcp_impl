</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think Kevin was making that claim; just that the more realistic
<BR>
TCP available with ns happens to be one that's close to the BSD lineage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In which case, are RFCs unambiguously in line with it?
</EM><BR>
<P>When they aren't, then that's right up tcp-impl's alley, as an
<BR>
implementation (or, much more rarely, a spec) problem.
<BR>
<P>One of the shortcomings of RFC 2001 is that it's defined in terms very
<BR>
closely matching the BSD implementation.  This instead needs to be
<BR>
widened somewhat, to accommodate other implementations that behave
<BR>
in accord with TCP congestion principles, but perhaps not with
<BR>
exactly how BSD TCPs implement them.  From a practical perspective,
<BR>
these differences are generally minor; but worth allowing for, so that
<BR>
other implementations are not unjustly held to be out of compliance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This still leaves with a fundamental problem. If I'm trying to design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broadband networks, and am trying to work out the interaction betweem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP and ATM, how can I have any certainty at all that the TCP based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications will behave in anyway that I predict.
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, yes.  Well, you try to understand what general TCP mechanisms have
<BR>
what general effects on your studies, and if you can show that minor
<BR>
variations in these mechanisms don't have much effect in your analysis,
<BR>
then you're okay.
