[ My apologies for being tardy with these ]
<BR>
<P>The TCP Implementation BOF was held at 3:30 PM, on Wednesday, December 11th.
<BR>
The BOF was intended to determine whether or not consensus exists for forming
<BR>
a working group for the purpose of making implementors aware of problems in
<BR>
current TCP implementations.
<BR>
<P>The BOF was co-chaired by Steve Alexander (<A HREF="mailto:sca@sgi.com?Subject=Re:%20San%20Jose%20TCP%20Implementation%20BOF%20Minutes&In-Reply-To=&lt;199701100442.UAA20328@refugee.engr.sgi.com&gt;">sca@sgi.com</A>) from Silicon Graphics
<BR>
and Vern Paxson (<A HREF="mailto:vern@ee.lbl.gov?Subject=Re:%20San%20Jose%20TCP%20Implementation%20BOF%20Minutes&In-Reply-To=&lt;199701100442.UAA20328@refugee.engr.sgi.com&gt;">vern@ee.lbl.gov</A>) of Lawrence Berkeley Labs.
<BR>
<P>Steve started off by presenting the BOF Agenda and then gave a motivation for
<BR>
having the BOF.  The idea (originally suggested by Jamshid Mahdavi and Matt
<BR>
Mathis) is to help TCP implementors improve the quality of their products by
<BR>
making them aware of problems in existing implementations and any tools or test
<BR>
suites that might make the development process more productive.
<BR>
<P>Vern Paxson then gave a presentation on the results of several research studies,
<BR>
which included work by Brakmo and Peterson; Comer and Lin; Stevens; Dawson,
<BR>
Jahanian, and Milton; and Paxson.
<BR>
<P>The above studies showed that many TCP implementations exhibit bad behavior
<BR>
at times, and that some of these problems can lead to a great deal of data
<BR>
being needlessly retransmitted.  Among the other problems mentioned were:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Some TCP implementations send data after having reset the connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Some do not acknowledge zero-window probes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Some throw away all data after a hole in the sequence space
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wide variety of MSS values (some very bizarre)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Many problems with keepalives
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Congestion avoidance algorithms such as slow-start are not ubiquitous
<BR>
<P>Vern wrapped up with an overview of two tools, ORCHESTRA, and tcpanaly.
<BR>
ORCHESTRA (<A HREF="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~sdawson">http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~sdawson</A>) is an x-kernel based tool that
<BR>
allows instrumentation of networking code.  It allows a developer to trace
<BR>
packets and generate probe packets.
<BR>
<P>tcpanaly is a tool that Vern has developed for post-processing of tcpdump
<BR>
traces.  It can detect anomalies in a TCP connection, particularly WRT
<BR>
congestion avoidance.
<BR>
<P>Steve Parker from SunSoft then gave a brief presentation on the Packet Shell,
<BR>
which is a tool that he and Chris Schmechel have been developing.  The packet
<BR>
shell is a set of TCL extensions that allows packet-level tests to be developed
<BR>
easily using the TCL scripting language.  Steve presented several examples of
<BR>
how this could be used to verify that a TCP is behaving correctly.  The packet
<BR>
shell is available at <A HREF="ftp://playground.sun.com/pub/sparker">ftp://playground.sun.com/pub/sparker</A>.
<BR>
<P>After the presentations concluded, discussion turned to the proposed charter
<BR>
and milestones for the working group, which were:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Produce a compilation of known problems and their solutions.  This will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raise awareness of these issues.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (optional) Determine if any problems found are the result of ambiguities
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the TCP specification.  If necessary, produce a document which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clarifies the specification.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Catalog existing TCP test suites, diagnostic tools, testing organizations,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and procedures that can be used by implementors to improve their code, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce a document enumerating them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Goals and Milestones:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec 96       Working group formation
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar 97       Produce initial document describing problems and fixes
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 97       Produce I-D which clarifies 793, 1122, 1323, if necessary
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 97       Produce initial catalog of test suites, etc.
<BR>
<P>A large percentage of the discussion centered around publically naming vendors
<BR>
with sub-optimal implementations.  It was emphasized several times that the
<BR>
group is targeted at developers, not at users or administrators.  In that
<BR>
context, it is not clear that mentioning implementors by name serves the
<BR>
group's purpose.  Allyn Romanow mentioned that the IESG is still determining
<BR>
whether doing so has any legal ramifications.  It was not clear that consensus
<BR>
was reached on this issue.
<BR>
<P>Another potentially controversial issue has to do with handling security
<BR>
issues.  Steve Bellovin argued in favor of being as open as possible about such
<BR>
matters.
<BR>
<P>Although the goal of updating the TCP specifications is potentially an
<BR>
unbounded problem, several people felt that it will be necessary.  In
<BR>
particular, Dave Borman presented a list of several items that he felt needed
<BR>
clarification.  Although there were few other specific issues mentioned, there
<BR>
seemed to be a growing belief that some enhancements to existing specifications
<BR>
will be needed.
<BR>
<P>It was generally felt that the scope of the group will need to be carefully
<BR>
defined in order to make forward progress.  For example, drawing the line
<BR>
between what is &quot;research&quot; and what is &quot;production code&quot; will be an issue.
<BR>
Discussion with the IRTF might be useful in evaluating this issue.
<BR>
<P>There was some discussion on test suites and test tools, although it did not
<BR>
appear that any conclusions were drawn.  At the present time, it is not clear
<BR>
that everyone agrees on what a test suite should do, or whether a test suite
<BR>
could be a product of an IETF group.
<BR>
<P>Bob Braden suggested that the proposed dates were wildly optimistic.  There
<BR>
was general agreement on this point.
<BR>
<P>Several other specific issues were raised:
<BR>
<P>There was a brief mention of SACK, and whether or not it is implemented widely
<BR>
enough to be addressed? (no consensus yet).
<BR>
<P>The question of issues surrounding asymmetric paths was raised as well.
<BR>
<P>Fred Baker raised the issue of performance over satellites as something that
<BR>
mighe be appropriate (there was no clear consensus on this being appropriate
<BR>
yet).
<BR>
<P>One concern was that a working group could become a perpetually ongoing effort.
<BR>
Some felt that this group could never really finish as long as TCP
<BR>
implementations keep evolving.  The consensus seemed to be that this might be
<BR>
true but that a first effort has to be successful prior to continuing on.  If
<BR>
the group cannot be productive initially, then the question is moot.
<BR>
<P>Some questions were raised about environmental assumptions present in the
<BR>
specifications, namely are there some, and if so are they clear?  It seems
<BR>
that further discussion is needed on this topic.
<BR>
<P>It was suggested that another potential deliverable is a guide to
<BR>
tuning/defaults for administrators.  Again, this needs further discussion, and
<BR>
may require working with the User Services area.
<BR>
<P>There seemed to be general agreement that a working group should be formed, but
<BR>
many details remain to be worked out about the charter and deliverables.
