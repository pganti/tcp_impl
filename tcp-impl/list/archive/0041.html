</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You make an interesting point - it's always easier to improve the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality of servers, which must be more robust, support more connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that generally act as clients that need the most improvement.  Sounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a dual approach of fixing the server side first if possible, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making recommendations for the clients, might be a good idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or gack, the three-pronged attack of getting the applications that
<BR>
behave poorly to do somethig a bit better? I suspect it is much easier
<BR>
to get people to download new versions of web browser foo that say
<BR>
shutdown first than it is to get them to upgrade their stack, and it is
<BR>
probably easier to get poeple to update webserver foo than the server
<BR>
stack. Or at least it looks like the web server and browser software is
<BR>
roolling with greater frequency than the transport implementations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; When BSDI upgraded their stack this past summer to make their Web server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;faster&quot;, they moved all the connections in the TIME_WAIT state onto their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own queue, to get them out of the tcp_slowtimo() function.  I'd bet that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the majority of the CPU savings right there.  (I've always thought that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BSD tcp_{slow,fast}timo() functions must be one of the biggest bottlenecks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on a busy system.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree.  PCB lookup costs have been analysed (the Sequent paper on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficient demultiplexing &amp; Jeff Mogul's &quot;Case for Persistent HTTP&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Network Behaviour of a Busy Web Server and its Clients&quot;). I wonder about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the effect of timer traversals of thousands of PCBs, especially on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cache.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect that many (bletch :) commercial stacks are getting tuned-up to
<BR>
handle large numbers of TIME_WAITs quite well. For some examples, you
<BR>
might look at the SPECweb96 results on www.specbench.org. There are some
<BR>
systems being benchmarked at over 1000 connections per second for
<BR>
fifteen minutes or more, which is a decent number of connections in the
<BR>
TIME_WAIT state at either 60 or 240 2*MSL.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If memory is then a problem (I think the BSDI code still saves the inpcb{}
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and the tcpcb{}; 384 bytes if my memory is right) then I'd bet you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; save a lot less state information for the TIME_WAIT state, similar to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; savings they obtained with the changes to help with the SYN flood attacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this fall.  If you could reduce the amount of state information down to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 32 bytes, then you have increased by one order or magnitude the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these TIME_WAIT connections for a given amount of memory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jeff Mogul's conclusions in his SIGCOMM paper were that memory occupancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was not a problem (less than a Mbyte of state for TIME-WAIT connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a busy web server) - at least for a web server.  I think you could get
</EM><BR>
<P>That depends on your definition of busy, the sice of the PCB, and the
<BR>
length of the TIME_WAIT state. At a high enough connection per second
<BR>
level, the memory occupied by TIME_WAITs can be rather larger than the
<BR>
web servers URL working-set - even for something like SPECweb96, which
<BR>
increases the working-set as the square-root of the requested load.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the state down to about 13 bytes (1 address + 2 ports + some bits) and
</EM><BR>
<P>Wouldn't we want a sequence number in there, or are we precluding the
<BR>
possibility of restarting a connection in TIME_WAIT?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The perceived costs of TIME-WAIT are still too high, if people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reducing the MSL from the (low) 60 seconds down to 10 seconds, or zero;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in addition it looks like a lot of RSTs are being used to avoid it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (5-10% on the DEC election server: see <A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/traces/netstat">ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/traces/netstat</A>).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think this should be flagged as a concern of the TCP implementors'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working group.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, lets make sure that abortive close does not get out of hand.
