Ah! Real data...I think we argued our way to this conclusion
<BR>
(painfully :-).
<BR>
<P>Two points I think worth flagging: a clarification of terminology
<BR>
for clients and servers in terms of closing/aborting/processes
<BR>
hanging/TCP connections neither transmitting nor receiving would
<BR>
be a good thing, particularly to distinguish application and protocol
<BR>
stack behaviour.  We got confused and we're supposed to understand this
<BR>
stuff :-) (oh, and I should have got hold of a network trace before
<BR>
mentioning it).
<BR>
<P>The other point is that there's sufficient ambiguities in application
<BR>
and TCP closing behaviour to merit a close look and a separate section
<BR>
in the WG deliverables (bug listing &amp; spec clarification).
<BR>
<P>On the trace:
<BR>
<P>client closes with FIN, server ACKs: 
<BR>
client in FIN-WAIT-2 advertising zero window (which makes a lot
<BR>
of sense since it cannot read any more)
<BR>
server in CLOSE-WAIT probing, all probes are ACKed with zero window.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me there are three approaches to fix this:
<BR>
<P>1.  client flushes the connection, ideally with a RFC 1122 RST
<BR>
(application has to workaround with a SO_LINGER otherwise)
<BR>
<P>2.  server times out eventually.  Apart from the load, here the
<BR>
server would have to deduce from the zero window received in CLOSE-WAIT
<BR>
that the client really meant to do a half duplex close, as opposed
<BR>
to advertising a zero window because of momentary buffer exhaustion.
<BR>
<P>3.  Moving the problem up one layer, either to HTTP as Josh suggests,
<BR>
or  Rick Jones suggestion of sucking all the data off and throwing
<BR>
it away and then closing (thereby moving the TIME-WAIT from server
<BR>
to client, a good thing)
<BR>
<P>The problem about 3 is that you never get a chance to flush unwanted
<BR>
data.  2 still ties up resources as Josh says.
