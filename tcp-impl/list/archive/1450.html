All it really takes is switching an IP address from one system to
<BR>
another in the event of failure. Then instead of being a question of how
<BR>
long it takes for a system to reboot, it becomes a question of how long
<BR>
it takes for the system failure to be detected and the IP address
<BR>
(identity) be assumed by the back-up system (and of course, whether or
<BR>
not the backup system was being kept up-to-date wrt TIME_WAIT.
<BR>
<P>Given the pressures on HA in certain markets, I think there is pressure
<BR>
to have this detection and failover happen in &lt;&lt; TIME_WAIT. I am
<BR>
reasonably confident that modulo icky things like DB recovery the
<BR>
switchovers are happening &lt; 60 seconds today on a number of platforms.
<BR>
Probably much less.
