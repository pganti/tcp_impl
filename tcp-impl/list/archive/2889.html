<P>OVERVIEW
<BR>
<P>Various wireless technologies and systems have been developed over the
<BR>
years, and all signs are indicating that many more are yet to come. For
<BR>
instance, traditional cellular systems have successfully provided voice
<BR>
services since the first analog system was introduced several decades ago.
<BR>
Satellite systems have also been used extensively in various military and
<BR>
commercial applications. Recently, with the growth of the mobile Internet,
<BR>
and the use of wireless technology in our daily life, wireless LANs, ad hoc
<BR>
networks, Bluetooth, home RF networks, and sensor networks are attracting
<BR>
more and more attention from both industrial and academic researchers.
<BR>
<P>The mushrooming of these heterogeneous wireless technologies calls for the
<BR>
ubiquitous and integrated wireless infrastructures to make the communication
<BR>
system robust and efficient. While the existing wireless networks have been
<BR>
extensively studied individually, the integrated wireless system brings new
<BR>
challenges in system management, protocol design, performance evaluation,
<BR>
QoS support, etc.
<BR>
<P>With this special issue we aim at bringing together state-of-the-art
<BR>
contributions in this emerging area of integrated heterogeneous wireless
<BR>
technologies that range from papers that report novel research to papers
<BR>
that describe commercial and industrial experiences. We are seeking for
<BR>
papers that are original, unpublished, and not currently under review by
<BR>
other conference, workshop, or journal. Topics of interest include, but are
<BR>
not limited to the following, with particular emphasis on the integration of
<BR>
heterogeneous wireless technologies:
<BR>
<P>·System architecture
<BR>
·Interoperation between wired, terrestrial wireless and satellite networks
<BR>
·Hybrid cellular systems, wireless LANs, ad hoc/sensor networks, Bluetooth
<BR>
·Location, Mobility and Handoff Management
<BR>
·System modeling and performance evaluation
<BR>
·Security and Privacy
<BR>
·Applications
<BR>
·Protocol design, analysis, and optimization
<BR>
·Routing (including multicasting and broadcasting)&amp;Energy efficient,
<BR>
self-organizing and resilient protocols&amp;Medium access control protocols &amp;
<BR>
TCP/IP over integrated wireless networks
<BR>
·Congestion, admission, and flow control
<BR>
·Quality of service in the hybrid networks
<BR>
·Implementation and testbed experiments
<BR>
<P>PUBLICATION SCHEDULE
<BR>
<P>·MANUSCRIPT DUE: Feb. 1, 2003
<BR>
·ACCEPTANCE NOTIFICATION: May 1, 2003
<BR>
·FINAL MANUSCRIPT DUE: July 1, 2003
<BR>
·EXPECTED PUBLICATION DATE: Fourth Quarter, 2003
<BR>
<P>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
<BR>
<P>Authors should email an electronic (Postscript or PDF) copy of their papers
<BR>
to Dr. Hongyi Wu, <A HREF="mailto:wu@cacs.louisiana.edu?Subject=Re:%20CFP%20Special%20Issue%20MONET%20on%20Integration%20of%20Heterogenous%20Wireless%20Technologies&In-Reply-To=&lt;052801c27508$236fc1b0$570aa8c0@muhmodisltsbmd&gt;">wu@cacs.louisiana.edu</A>, by Feb. 1, 2003. Submissions should
<BR>
be limited to 20 double space pages excluding figures, graphs and
<BR>
illustrations. If email submission is impossible then six (6) copies of the
<BR>
paper (double-sided if possible) should be sent by the due date to Dr.
<BR>
Hongyi Wu. All submissions will be reviewed following the standard
<BR>
procedure.
