I'm cc'ing <A HREF="mailto:multi6@ops.ietf.org?Subject=RE:%20Multiple%20TCP%20source%20addresses?&In-Reply-To=&lt;7695E2F6903F7A41961F8CF888D87EA81C9BFB@red-msg-06.redmond.corp.microsoft.com&gt;">multi6@ops.ietf.org</A>, which was recently formed to discuss site
<BR>
multihoming issues like this, albeit in the context of IPv6 instead of IPv4.
<BR>
This is definitely an important problem to solve.
<BR>
<P>You're headed down the path to one possible solution, in which hosts have
<BR>
multiple addresses and are smart enough to try different combinations of
<BR>
src/dst address to find a working path.
<BR>
<P>There are other approaches that are more routing based. For example suppose
<BR>
your house has one address prefix, which was allocated out of a block
<BR>
assigned to your metro area/region. Your house network prefix is advertised
<BR>
inside all ISP networks in your region, but not to other regions. Only the
<BR>
shorter region prefix is advertised to other regions. Then routing protocols
<BR>
take care of finding a working path inside the metro region.

<EM>&gt; Subject: Multiple TCP source addresses?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've got a problem I'm trying to invent a solution to and I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ask if there's any past work I should look at, or perhaps it's already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been solved and I just don't know it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of the hosts on my home LAN are multihomed; I have address space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from two different places and I run both subnets over the same house
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ethernet.  (Network interfaces are configured to have both addresses.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sometimes one block of address space is reachable while the other one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't, and outgoing packets are routed to one of two tunnels (one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each provider of address space) based on which subnet their source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addresses fall into.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This all works well in normal circumstances.  The problem is with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outgoing connections when one block of address space is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unreachable for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some reason.  All the hosts have their default routes pointing to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off-LAN gateway, but I had to pick one of its two addresses, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source address for the outgoing connection is always in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corresponding subnet.  When that subnet is unreachable from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destination host, outgoing connections fail even if I do have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connectivity to that host via the other subnet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could deal with the case where a subnet goes completely unreachable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a routing protocol of some sort, perhaps.  But 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reachability is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always all-or-nothing; depending on where the outage is, which hosts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can reach which subnet varies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I'd like to do something so that outgoing connections for which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application has not specified a source address don't always try with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one source address and give up if that doesn't work; conceptually, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like to try from all local addresses.  I was thinking of sending out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple SYNs, one for each local address; as soon as one gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SYN-ACKed, that would commit the local address and SYN-ACKs for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others would draw RSTs.  It does occur to me that I may want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; round-robin among the addresses, rather than in bursts, to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creating unnecessary embryonic connections on the taget host in case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both addresses work.  (Of course, they would be torn down quickly in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response to the RST, but still.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Comments?  Thoughts?  Prior art?
