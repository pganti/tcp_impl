<EM>&gt; Our algorithm worked because the window size was controlled to reflect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of sequence retention policy. It seems to me that modifying your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2nd para. in the SHOULD above slightly to indicate that in cases where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a TCP host is memory limited - that a combination of window size 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; management and limited out of sequence retention can be used to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; balance memory usage and network behavior.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.  While I appreciate this point, I'm still wondering why in
<BR>
limited-memory situations one would advertise a window exceeding available
<BR>
buffer.  Why not just advertise a window equal to the buffer to ensure that
<BR>
above-sequence data can be retained?
<BR>
<P>A natural answer is: for added performance.  But the only time a bigger
<BR>
window buys you performance is for a large bandwidth-delay path.  These are
<BR>
generally WANs, which are quite prone to packet loss, for which failing to
<BR>
retain the above-sequence data is potentially a serious congestion
<BR>
problem.  If the main performance concern is for a LAN, then I'd think it
<BR>
wouldn't be hard to have enough buffer to support a sufficiently large
<BR>
window, because due to the smaller bandwidth-delay product the window
<BR>
doesn't actually have to be very big.  Say it's an Ethernet with a 1 msec
<BR>
RTT.  Then:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Mbps / (8 b/B) * .001 sec = 1250 bytes is all you need!
