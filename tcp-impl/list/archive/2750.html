<P>
Anumita,
<BR>
<P>Core aspects may deserve separate consideration:
<BR>
&nbsp;Long distance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Transoceanic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Transcontinental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Satellite
<BR>
&nbsp;Metropolitan
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Central Office
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Head-end
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pax
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cable
<BR>
<P>Provisioning of these aspects create the Core and each have respective
<BR>
limitations based on deployment.  Last mile technologies have seen
<BR>
reductions in basic service to assist in with Core issues as improved access
<BR>
(last mile) technologies become popular.  Although technology allows
<BR>
phenomenal bandwidth, this is not without a requisite investment.  Early
<BR>
investments in this technology were stranded as growth slowed.  Expectations
<BR>
of improvement in basic service have diminished as have investments.
<BR>
<P>A good Core network must be over-provisioned to allow fail-over and,
<BR>
although routers are better at handling saturation, lack of free bandwidth
<BR>
does have a dramatic service impact.  There is a significant difference in
<BR>
the level of basic service between countries owning to adequate essential
<BR>
Core and population densities that constrain cost.  Some aspect of the Core
<BR>
is a constraint where small changes in access will absorb available
<BR>
bandwidth.  Web caching is an effort to relieve Core constraints, as
<BR>
example.
<BR>
<P>Will greatly improved CPU and LAN technologies press for improved basic
<BR>
access?  What model for Core provisioning is used to keep pace?  To use the
<BR>
network to enjoy multimedia, then the present 1 mb/s must be improved to a
<BR>
reliable 6 mb/s for broadcast quality, and 11 to 22 mb/s for high
<BR>
definition.
<BR>
<P>The many Mice (low-rate last mile) will still scare away the Elephants if
<BR>
sharing under provisioned Core.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Can the arguments about disk drives, memory capacity be really extended

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; links ever exceeded the rate at which the number of internet users are

<EM>&gt; increasing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, should we not also consider the &quot;bandwidth&quot; of the core

<EM>&gt; routers/switches, that is the rate at which their ability to
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; enough?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Is it not true that overprovisioning is never a long term solution,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as bandwidth is never ever enough? As Alan says, &quot;Usage expands to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fit network bandwidth&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have a DSL line, track its usage. You will find that ~1Mbps is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than sufficient most of the time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, applications sometimes catch up. However, whenever a resource is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scarce the assumption is that usage will always catch up. The arguments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; held in the past for disk drives, memory capacity, and CPU speed. Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are, for most purposes, overprovisioned very easily for all but a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fraction of the time for most users.
