<P>
Kathie,
<BR>
<P>The objection to IW&gt;1 is that it may have adverse affects on already
<BR>
congested networks that are dominated by HTTP transfers.  You have not
<BR>
done simulations on a congested link dominated by HTTP so your results
<BR>
are not applicable to the assertion that IW&gt;1 may be harmful.
<BR>
<P>If you limit the rate of requests to one request every 1-5 seconds
<BR>
after completion and transfers complete in 0.5 to 0.7 seconds, with 16
<BR>
clients, the link utilizations are very low.  Since each client is
<BR>
idle for 3 soconds on avergae, they have a 1/6 duty cycle and 16/6
<BR>
HTTP transfers can be expected to be active.  If you have 1-8 long
<BR>
running ftp transfer, then the traffic on the link is dominated by the
<BR>
ftp.  It is not at all surprising that a very small amount of HTTP
<BR>
traffic had a negligible effect on the TCPs dominating the traffic and
<BR>
it is also not surprising that the slightly more aggressive HTTPs did
<BR>
a little better.
<BR>
<P>One thing you did not mention is the size of the HTTP transfers.  I
<BR>
don't think you mentioned the queue capacity either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Packet drop rates did increase with IW, but the change was not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant.  For the drop-tail simulations, the drop rates on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congested link for all flows range from 0.6-1.0% for 4 FTPs, 1.6-1.9%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for 6 FTPs, and 2.4-2.8% for 8 FTPs.  For the RED scenarios the ranges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were 1.8-2.0% for 4 FTPs, 2.9-3.2% for 6 FTPs, and 4.0-4.2% for 8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FTPs. Since the increased drop rates were accompanied by better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance, it's clear that, for these low rates, drop rate is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly not an indicator of user level performance.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect the drop rate for 0 FTPs was exactly zero and 1 FTP was
<BR>
close to zero.  These are uncongested.  You also didn't mention the
<BR>
bottleneck link utilization.  If the link utilization drops with the
<BR>
increase in loss then this will have an adverse on already congested
<BR>
links (anything that loweres bottleneck utilization is a problem for
<BR>
already congested links.
<BR>
<P>Most of the US Internet seems to still be running under 5% loss or
<BR>
even under 1% loss.  On portions of the Internet, drop rates are
<BR>
already 5-15%.  I think the US to Europe problems of 25-50% loss are
<BR>
now a thing of the past.  Portions of the world are living with
<BR>
underprovisioned networks and higher loss rates  outside the US and
<BR>
western Europe.
<BR>
<P>It would be interesting to try this with increasing numbers of HTTP
<BR>
clients such that the loss rate with no FTP was in the 1% range, in
<BR>
the 5% range, and in the 15% range.  Then increase IW and see what the
<BR>
effect is.
<BR>
<P>While I dodn't advocate running links at 1% loss or more, we must
<BR>
consider reality.
<BR>
<P>Curtis
