<P>
BTW, on review, I believe the `sequence number attacks' section is
<BR>
actually irrelevant.  The comment about TIME-WAIT state is incorrect,
<BR>
because TIME-WAIT can be assassinated even with normal TCP.  This
<BR>
causes the entire logic of the argument to fall apart.  It's also the
<BR>
case that this is only really relevant for applications using
<BR>
host-based authorization, which should be disabling T/TCP for the
<BR>
other reasons I mentioned.  (I actually noticed this once before, but
<BR>
due to the distinct lack of feedback I never updated the draft.)
<BR>
<P>So, let's assume for a moment that there are correct implementations
<BR>
resolving the concerns mentioned in sections 2 (`Host-Based
<BR>
Authorization') and 4 (`Pre-SYN Queueing'), and that section 5
<BR>
(`Sequence Number Attacks') is simply discarded.  That still leaves
<BR>
the concerns in section 3 (`SYN flooding') and 6 (`Conclusions').
<BR>
<P>I could easily give on the interoperability problem mentioned in
<BR>
section 6.  It's specifically the client using T/TCP and connecting to
<BR>
an old server that causes the problem.  It doesn't matter whether or
<BR>
not a server uses T/TCP.  So this problem isn't particularly relevant
<BR>
to service operators.
<BR>
<P>However, the potential for denial of service attacks is still real,
<BR>
and I don't see any way around it.
<BR>
<P>Now, I expect at this point someone will simply fire up a stupid SYN
<BR>
flooding engine and claim that nothing happened.  So I will explain a
<BR>
simple scenario that your SYN flooding tool didn't exercise, but which
<BR>
will completely hose your server:
<BR>
<P>* Say you have a CGI script that takes 1 second of real time to load.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of sites -- especially ones with fancy shopping carts and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;whatnot -- have a plethora of these.
<BR>
<P>* Now say I flood you at a pretty slow rate, perhaps 11 packets every
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 seconds, with requests that exercise this particular CGI script.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we're using T/TCP, I only need 1 packet per probe to do this,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and I never have to see the replies.
<BR>
<P>* In not too much time at all, I'll have hundreds of httpd processes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on your machine stuck waiting for this damned CGI script, and not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;processing any real requests.
<BR>
<P>* Your customers get pissed off.
<BR>
<P>Scale the numbers to suit your CGI scripts, of course.  It doesn't
<BR>
matter; the point is still the same.
<BR>
