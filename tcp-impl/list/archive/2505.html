<P><EM>&gt; The stack has to determine the initial window size, and all it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has is the address of the other host, and MSS derived from MTU.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, &quot;the stack&quot; is just code.  BSD-style code could
<BR>
follow the if pointers to find the interface speed as easily
<BR>
as it now finds the interface MTU to generate the MSS option.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Practically speaking, most stacks use a hard-wired default (32k
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or 8k or whatever). They could a better job taking MSS into account. 
</EM><BR>
<P>agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To your other point, MTU definitely  has to do with the speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and memory on the adaptor. That's why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you will see higher MTUs with higher speeds. 
</EM><BR>
<P>It is true that as the years have passed, media have become faster
<BR>
as MTU's generally have grown longer.  However, Ethernet is a rather
<BR>
important counter example.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; As far as 6-8 times the MTU being from mid 80s is not correct either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, BSD 4.3 Reno had 2k windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for local communications, which is even less than that ratio.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6-8 figure is based on my own experiments and measurements done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the early 90s.
</EM><BR>
<P>So in about 1986 I did not change the default TCP window shipped by one of
<BR>
the major commercial UNIX vendors to 30K?  And in about 1988 I didn't
<BR>
change it to 60K?  That's interesting, because I didn't think I'd become
<BR>
so senile that I'd invent such recollections.  (Note that I don't mean
<BR>
that I changed it from the default that someone at the factory set.  I
<BR>
mean that according to those false recollections of mine, I was that
<BR>
someone at the factory.)
<BR>
<P>Yes, as a reasult of my enthusiasm for better`ttcp` numbers to give to my
<BR>
employer's sales people (and my own bosses), I also saw some bug reports
<BR>
of interoperability problems.  Some were related to bugs in other vendors'
<BR>
systems uncovered by large mismatches in window sizes.
