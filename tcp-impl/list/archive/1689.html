We are running some HTTP applications on Solaris 2.6 platform. In some 
<BR>
tcp connections, we noticed that the ssthresh was initialized to a 
<BR>
very low value (for example, 2 MSSs) for some reason, even though 
<BR>
there were no packet losses in these connections. The slow start phase 
<BR>
in these connections was very short, and the cwnd stays at low values 
<BR>
because of the slow increasing in linear phase. This behavior leads to 
<BR>
long delay and low throughput in the application.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
It is also noticed that if there are no more packet losses, the 
<BR>
ssthresh will stay at the same low value for all consequent TCP 
<BR>
connections. ssthresh will increase only if there is a packet loss. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
We assumed that the above problem was caused by caching the ssthresh in 
<BR>
the routing table. It seems that caching ssthresh might not always 
<BR>
be desired.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
I have two questions regarding the Solaris 2.6 implementation:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
1) ssthresh is saved in the routing table when a tcp connection is 
<BR>
closed. A condition for saving the ssthresh is that there must be at 
<BR>
least a certain amount of data transferred during the connection. BSD 
<BR>
uses 16 times the high water mark of the send buffer. Solaris 2.6 does 
<BR>
not seem to be using the same value. Does anybody know what the 
<BR>
condition is for saving ssthresh in Solaris 2.6?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
2) I assumed that the ssthresh in the routing table will timeout 
<BR>
eventually if there are no more updates to it after some time. Does 
<BR>
anyone know what the timer is for this in Solaris 2.6?
