<EM>&gt; From: &quot;Eric A. Hall&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ehall@ehsco.com?Subject=Re:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902171448.HAA03396@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">ehall@ehsco.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On a lark I did a search for +&quot;nagle algorithm&quot; on AltaVista, and almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all references to it are things that explain what it is and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; admonish the programmer from using it. I'm starting to wonder too if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anybody actually disables it for non-interactive, non-realtime stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would anyone care, since you're talking about &quot;non-interactive,
<BR>
non-realtime stuff&quot;, and the worst effect of Nagle on bulk transfers is
<BR>
an extra 0.1 second delay in sending the FIN?
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Winsock FAQ:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://telin.rug.ac.be/~sid/Netwerken/Winsock/advanced.html#q15">http://telin.rug.ac.be/~sid/Netwerken/Winsock/advanced.html#q15</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>That talks about an especially weak reason to turn off the Nagle
<BR>
algorithm, to try to retain packet boundaries on the wire, presumably
<BR>
so that application receive requests get the same block boundaries
<BR>
as sent by the sender.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>That's a nice ASCII version of the Winsock 1 spec.  Thanks.
<BR>
I see it mentions RCVBUF and SNDBUF

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this particular test, disabling Nagle helped a lot since the data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being returned from the HTTP server was sent as two writes (one for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MIME header and another for the data).
</EM><BR>
<P>The following sentence in that paper is interesting:
<BR>
<P>|   Apache supports keep-alive connections, an early implementation
<BR>
|   of P-HTTP.  When handling a keep-alive connection, Apache sends
<BR>
|   its headers as a separate segment. (It does so to work around
<BR>
|   a bug in a popular browser.)
<BR>
<P>That seems to me to imply that of the two reasons to turn off the Nagle
<BR>
algorithm in Apache, broken writes like those and what they call the
<BR>
&quot;Odd/Short-Final-Segment Problem&quot;, the first forces them to turn off Nagle
<BR>
regardless.  That means that while the second would be helped by the
<BR>
proposed modification to Nagle, it is moot.  In other words, it's
<BR>
consistent with my claim that the proposed modification to Nagle won't
<BR>
gain anything in the real world.
<BR>
<P>(I am puzzled by that work-around for the browser bug.  Apache cannot
<BR>
guarantee that its segments won't be combined by the sending kernel.
<BR>
Oh well, maybe it works often enough to be worthwhile.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html</A> also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discusses the issue some, suggesting that Nagle made no effect on some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pipelined transactions, while it did have an effect in others.
</EM><BR>
<P>They're talking about turning off Nagle regardless because sometimes doing
<BR>
so helps a lot.  That again makes the proposed modification moot.
