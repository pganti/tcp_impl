<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't believe that a stack with an IW=2 will have interoperability

<EM>&gt; &gt; issues communicating with a stack with IW=1.  The initial congestion

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That depends on the direction. Clearly, the IW=1 stack in SOlaris did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not work well with the IW=2 stack of Win95/NT - that is what I was using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a guesstimate that most other popular stacks on the net were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively IW=2.

I still don't see how this is a problem.  Are you sure the reason
<BR>
that the Solaris and Win95/NT stacks didn't work well together
<BR>
was due to the IWs used?  The Solaris stack has at least one
<BR>
problem that was mentioned a while ago concerning premature
<BR>
timeouts when the RTT is fairly large.
<BR>
<P>One output from this group will be an update to RFC2001.  We may, 
<BR>
if appropriate, increase the cwnd to something larger than 1.  Once
<BR>
this is done a number of stack vendors will update their stacks to
<BR>
reflect the new initial cwnd.  So, for a potentially long period of
<BR>
time, the net will have a number of stacks with IW=1 communicating
<BR>
with stacks that have IW&gt;1.  If, as you assert, IW=1 stacks do not 
<BR>
work well with IW&gt;1 stacks then the change to RFC2001 will be 
<BR>
creating a problem.  
<BR>
<P>I personally don't belive that this will be a problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Just a data point, OSF1 v3.2c by DEC has IW=1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cool - any guesstimate what the &quot;Internet weight&quot; of OSF1 v3.2c happens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
While DEC may not be very popular, they do implement a damn good
<BR>
TCP stack.
