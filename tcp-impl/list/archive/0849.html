<EM>&gt; I'm confused by this comment.  If by delivered you mean to the application,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then this seems unlikely - it requires that a new connection is very quickly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; established with the same ephemeral port and insufficient ISN advance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess the combination of a proxy that reuses ephemeral ports plus bad luck
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with randomized ISN generation could do this; I wouldn't consider that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;very likely&quot;, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If by delivered you mean transmitted over the network, then since it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already in flight, a FIN exchange wouldn't prevent that, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Sorry about the delay in replying.  I meant &quot;delivered to the peer TCP&quot;.
<BR>
I agree that delivery to an application is unlikely.  I was making the
<BR>
point that after a RST, one is much more likely to get data than after
<BR>
a FIN exchange.  So RSTs are more dangerous than reducing the MSL after
<BR>
FIN exchange; if you worry about the latter, you might might to want
<BR>
to worry about RSTS, unless RST use is very unlikely.  
<BR>
<P>The current mechanisms rely on no data arriving after the connection
<BR>
closes...even if it does, the ISN and port sequence numbers provide
<BR>
further protection.  So the dangers are relatively low.  I guess the
<BR>
issue is whether they are less than the probability of data corruption
<BR>
which does not modify the checksum.
