<EM>&gt; From: Vern Paxson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vern@ee.lbl.gov?Subject=RE:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;199909152045.NAA04854@random.teraflop.com&gt;">vern@ee.lbl.gov</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would agree with Allyn that this sets a terrible precedent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In the past, whenever change to TCP was proposed, the answer has been
</EM><BR>
that 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there are millions of existing TCP instances out there so we could not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; change it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sorry to say it, but the time to have voiced concerns over this change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was during the IETF Last Call on the diffserv documents.  It is too late now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to rescind the fact that the diffserv architecture allows for modification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the TOS byte in flight.
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking unofficially from an embedded-SW supplier with a network stack,
<BR>
I have to say &quot;resolve this like engineers and scientists, not lawyers&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I mean, others could respond with &quot;the time to have voiced concerns over
<BR>
TCP TOS was in 1981&quot;. To attempt to squelch the technical complaints and
<BR>
interoperation concerns with a lawyer-type &quot;sorry, too late&quot; response is
<BR>
not, I hope, the way IETF debates will go in the future.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;just upgrade&quot; argument is dangerous. A relatively new GHS product
<BR>
element is a TCP exclusively deployed in embedded systems. It doesn't have
<BR>
the MacTCP problem, but it could have. It's also annoying to hear &quot;just
<BR>
upgrade&quot; after all the hype about internet protocol appliances and networked
<BR>
embedded systems.  If the IETF doesn't really mean that, come out and say
<BR>
it: &quot;It's only for desktops and servers running supported and upgradable SW.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Now, perhaps the diffserv steamroller is all worth it. My point isn't that
<BR>
diffserv should change and not TCP, it's that this argument needs to be
<BR>
decided on technical merits and not by hiding behind administrative
<BR>
procedure, and that the &quot;just upgrade&quot; argument should be used with care.
<BR>
<P>How, exactly, do you propose to test compatibility with embedded systems?
<BR>
It's going to be hard, which is why we usually just make compatible
<BR>
extensions.
