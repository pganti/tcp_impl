<P>
Vernon (and others, i am sure),
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As the discussion has gone on, there seems to me less justification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for changing the Nagle algorithm.  Could someone review the plausible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenarios where the change helps?  (I.e. not just switching the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation of &quot;send&quot; from what it seems no one used to something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closer to what everyone is doing.) 
</EM><BR>
<P>The scenario is that TCP has been willing to send lots of data because (either 
<BR>
at tcp_output() or at send()) it was presented with &quot;lots&quot; of data to send (&gt;= 
<BR>
MSS), and so has sent lots of data.  Now, it is presented (either at 
<BR>
tcp_output() or at send()) with a &quot;little bit&quot; of data.  In this case, TCP 
<BR>
will wait until all the previous data has been acknowledged.
<BR>
<P>(The change would allow TCP to transmit this &quot;little bit&quot; of data (but not 
<BR>
transmit any subsequent &quot;little bit&quot; of data until *this* &quot;little bit&quot; of data 
<BR>
has been acknowledged.)
<BR>
<P>Greg (who believes many things, such as that a mode of program-controlled 
<BR>
flushing would probably be a good API addition, and that some heuristics to 
<BR>
delayed ACKs might be a good thing [but make sure you understand about Silly 
<BR>
Window Syndrome avoidance before messing too much with that! -- see RFC813, 
<BR>
one of the Dave Clark 5], etc., but *still* feels this change will help things)
<BR>
