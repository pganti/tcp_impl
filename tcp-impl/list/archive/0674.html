<EM>&gt; The check that is done at that trigger can be based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	idle time since last send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	idle time since last receive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	current window state
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't agree that the line between implementation and research is the same
<BR>
as that between detecting loss of the ack clock vs. what to do about it.
<BR>
I agree that, in principle, detecting loss of the clock by inspecting the
<BR>
window state is on a par with doing so based on idle time, and perhaps better.
<BR>
But I think in practice there's a significant difference.  If &quot;current window
<BR>
state&quot; is based on how much data has been acked by the most recent ack (which
<BR>
is what I understand you mean by it), then (1) connection performance along
<BR>
the forward path will now be degraded by conditions along the reverse path
<BR>
(due to lost acks), which is not presently the case; and (2) people interested
<BR>
in playing tricks with acks (e.g., for bandwidth-asymmetric paths) will lose
<BR>
big if those tricks are considered by the endpoint to reflect loss of the ack
<BR>
clock.  So I think the window-state approach will be significantly more
<BR>
contentious than the idle-time approach.  Since we're trying to go for
<BR>
minimal changes and minimal contention, our present course should be to
<BR>
codify/correct the existing idle-time scheme, and not try at this point to
<BR>
standardize on a different approach.
