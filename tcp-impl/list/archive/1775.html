<P>
<EM>&gt; Doubt-2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The RFC says that  (this is just after connection diag. in the section 3.4)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;1. If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     in response to any incoming segment except another reset. In particular, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected by this means. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     RFC seems to be saying that SYN addressed to non-existent connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     is illegal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Basically, yes, though I would prefer a different word, since it's
<BR>
valid to attempt to connect when there's nobody listening.  The
<BR>
receiving TCP stack just has to reject the attempt.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     But, I think that when we are opening a connection, the SYN can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     be addressed to ONLY non-existent connection because SYN only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     starts up the connection.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a flaw in the language.  When there is &quot;someone there&quot;, the
<BR>
receiving stack has a TCB in SYN-SENT or LISTEN (the former only in the
<BR>
case of a simultaneous open, something that I suspect essentially never
<BR>
happens in practice).  In the sentence you emphasized, I believe
<BR>
&quot;connection&quot; really means &quot;address/port pair&quot; (loosely, &quot;socket&quot;).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; RFC says that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The sending TCP must be prepared to accept from the user and send at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  least one octet of new data even if the send window is zero. The sending 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  TCP must regularly retransmit to the receiving TCP even when the window 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is zero.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1. when send window is 0, how tcp will be able send data?
</EM><BR>
<P>It can't.  The point of this low-rate constant retransmission is to
<BR>
probe the window, so that in case it opens but the packet carrying that
<BR>
fact manages to get lost in transit, data transfer doesn't stall
<BR>
indefinitely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  2. does it mean that retransmission are not affected by the present
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     window size (0 in the above case)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Retransmission of what?  Zero-window probes are very different from
<BR>
retransmitting already-sent data.  I don't recall offhand what you're
<BR>
supposed to do if you send some data that's in-window, the peer shrinks
<BR>
its advertised window so that what you sent is partially (or entirely)
<BR>
past the window before acking what you sent, and then your
<BR>
retransmission timer goes off.  It seems to me there's little point in
<BR>
sending data outside what you think the window is, except for two
<BR>
cases: (1) zero-window probes and (2) when the bandwidth*delay product
<BR>
is high enough that the window is likely to have opened by the time the
<BR>
segment arrives.  The latter case is hard enough to predict that it's
<BR>
probably better addressed by window-enlargement schemes, it seems to
<BR>
me.  (If the bandwidth*delay product is larger than the peer's
<BR>
available buffer space, but the peer is fast enough to swallow bits at
<BR>
full path bandwidth, this strategy will lose.  I suspect this is
<BR>
relatively rare.)
