<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vernon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree with you and agree with Bernie.  If you have both an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FDDI and and ethernet interface, it makes sense to use an MSS of 4352,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not 1500.  Then, if routing changes from the ethernet to the FDDI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Path MTU code can discover the larger MTU.  But if you sent a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1500 MSS, you're stuck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most systems should be able to send an MSS of 65535, but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an optimization to use the MTU of the largest/outgoing interface.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And in the bad old days, hosts weren't smart enough to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller packets when presented with a large MSS, so using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MTU of the outing interface made much more sense.  But in todays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world, there's no reason to limit yourself to small MSS values.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The biggest problem with PMTU is all the hosts that still stick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 576 in the MSS because the other host is not &quot;local&quot;.  Using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1500 instead of 4352 when you have both FDDI and Ethernet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same sort of problem, only not as severe.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Why not use an MSS of 65535?  What is being optimized by the choice of
<BR>
MSS?  I think most systems can IP fragment faster than they can TCP
<BR>
segment, so they are better off sending 64K TCP segments as a bunch of
<BR>
IP fragments.  (I've liked that idea ever since someone told me about
<BR>
using it in an FDDI adapter for a certain supercomputer company's bus
<BR>
to get what was then an impressive TCP/IP/FDDI speed.)
<BR>
<P>What if someone turns on that HIPPI interface with the 64K MTU that was
<BR>
turned off when the TCP connection was established?  (Those 700
<BR>
Mbit/sec TCP/IP/HIPPI numbers are a tad easier with a full size MSS.)
<BR>
<P>The reason I see to use a smaller MSS is safety or conservatism.  If
<BR>
PMTU discovery were perfect, there would be no reason to use anything
<BR>
except MSS=64K.  In the real world, if you use a larger MSS than your
<BR>
minimum MTU, then you risk fragmentation if PMTU discovery is not used
<BR>
or usable by the TCP peer.  If you use too small an MSS, you pay in
<BR>
performance.  (As Rick Jones and I keep saying, a good value for the
<BR>
cost of using an MTU of 1500 over FDDI is 4352/1500, and that aint hay.)
<BR>
<P>In the FDDI/Ethernet case and if you always use MSS=4352, what happenss if:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. the peer could do PMTU discovery but it has been turned off
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because some smart guy has installed some Cabletron or Network
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peripherals FDDI-Ethernet bridges, or a DEC FDDI-Ethernet bridge
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and failed to set the bridge's IP address.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. the peer is one of the many millions of boxes that either do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not support PMTU discovery at all or do not support it by default.
<BR>
<P>In #1, TCP will work for some stuff, but simply not work at all for big
<BR>
stuff.  At SGI we demonstrated that between a couple of major internal
<BR>
email systems, where small messages went just fine, but bigger messages
<BR>
started and then the TCP connection would mysteriously die as the
<BR>
bridges silently discarded packets with DF=1.
<BR>
<P>In #2, at best your routers will be IP fragmenting.
