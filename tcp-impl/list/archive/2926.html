<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd be very careful fixing the IP ID - I have been told by one major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;interconnect&quot; vendor that some of their products have ways to allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;the customer (at customers persistent request) to cause the devices to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;ignore and clear the DF bit...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;That would be a violation of the STDs (1812, 791), which could cause 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;problems that would be very difficult to debug (e.g., path MTU, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I.e., you're worried about changing the IP ID field because vendors who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;violate standards will break? Go right ahead, IMO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Laws for the lawless are a waste of effort (shades of NAT).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An admirable attitude, but even Linux backtracked on this IP ID issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when faced with practical connectivity problems.  Linux for a time used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to set IP ID zero if DF was set, but went back to setting changing IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IDs for TCP with DF.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I'm asserting is that what we do should be related to the 
<BR>
standards, not necessarily what NAT-supporting vendors need to make 
<BR>
their systems still work.
<BR>
<P>I mean that anyone who clears the DF bit gets what they deserve - a 
<BR>
nonfunctioning brick.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not a Linux kernel developer, but I think that change back is related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the comment in the kernel include/net/ip.h:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	/* This is only to work around buggy Windows95/2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	 * VJ compression implementations.  If the ID field
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	 * does not change, they drop every other packet in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	 * a TCP stream using header compression.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	 */
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure we want specs to provide workarounds for bugs. Bugs should 
<BR>
be fixed at the source.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also think I have observed a middlebox clearing DF; circumstantial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence not proof though.  It appeared to me, from remote observation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a HTTP load balancing device was clearing DF on TCP segments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; en-route from HTTP servers to clients.  I presume this is because the load
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; balancer's developers could not be bothered to &quot;route&quot; ICMP fragmentation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed back to the appropriate HTTP server.  If this is correct, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; load balancer isn't cleverly changing the IP ID, there could be problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if TCP stacks don't set a real IP ID.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It's horrid, and wrong.  But it is a problem for practical connectivity.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a bug that needs to be fixed, but not one that should drive standards.
<BR>
