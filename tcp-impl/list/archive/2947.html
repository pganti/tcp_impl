Hi
<BR>
<P>This pertains to the subject of detecting duplicate segments from
<BR>
earlier incarnations of the same connection. For the same incarnation of
<BR>
a connection, RFC 1323 recommends PAWS and it works correctly to detect
<BR>
duplicate segments, but for a different incarnation (Appendix B.2 of the
<BR>
RFC), it seems to indicate that PAWS as it is  will not work, and it
<BR>
needs to be augmented with a  mechanism which  maintains a per host
<BR>
timestamp cache which saves the last timestamp received from that host
<BR>
and this value is needed to be used in the PAWS test.
<BR>
<P>I dont quite understand this, if the timestamp clock  of the sender is
<BR>
guaranteed to increment by at least 1 since the last time the connection
<BR>
was closed, the duplicate which appears after the new incarnation of the
<BR>
connection has been established, should be detected by the PAWS test as
<BR>
is, without requiring any additional mechanism. My intent is to
<BR>
understand whether it is true that PAWS test (as it is w/o requiring any
<BR>
additional mechanism) can  replace the functionality of detecting and
<BR>
expiring duplicate segments provided by the TIME-WAIT state.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
Murali
