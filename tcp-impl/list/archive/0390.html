<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Given that the active side has to be conservative, your heuristic is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fine.  How do you decide whether to try negotiating on TCP Timestamps?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why not the same?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, because, as Matt anticipated, my next question was going to be about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP SACK.  There is no heuristic there because I always want to try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negotiate it on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In general, we need to examine whether it is feasible to blackball any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation that can not swallow unrecognized options on SYN segments,
</EM><BR>
<P>Blackball implementations?  I don't know about your situation, but the
<BR>
sales and support people I deal with say the funniest things whenever I
<BR>
say something like &quot;that other vendor's system is broken junk; tell
<BR>
the customer to throw it out and get something that works.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; or do we have to provide a global switch to disable use of anything other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the MSS option.  If the problem is sufficiently widespread, you then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to ship with the global switch in the conservative position, to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having system administrators everywhere going nuts discovering that they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to throw the switch.  Few, if any, will then enable use of these options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do hope that we can decide that this approach is not neccessary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can we try to gather some specific details on the extent of the problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which specific implementations crash on receipt of options other than MSS,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and which do not crash but do black hole the connection request?
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've tried to say before, global options are of very little utility,
<BR>
unless you are building single-purpose, probably embedded boxes.  If
<BR>
you're building a multi-purpose box, then even when your box wants to
<BR>
use a newfangled TCP (or IP or whatever) option with host X, it will
<BR>
also have to deal with cruffty old hosts U,V,W,Y, and Z.  Consider a
<BR>
box that wants to talk to some peers where a fancy TCP option is a good
<BR>
thing (e.g. SACK and satellites) but also wants to use FTP and STMP to
<BR>
any of millions of systems on the Internet.  No matter how you set a
<BR>
global switch, it will be wrong.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I'd pick linking SACK with TCP-LW. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A peer that can handle timestamps and window shifts is likely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do the right thing with SACK or other new options (including
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoring it if not understood)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if you want selective ACK's, you probably want large windows in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least one direction, and vice versa,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;Be conservative in what you send ...&quot; is not just a good idea. 
<BR>
It's the only thing that works outside of ivory towers.
