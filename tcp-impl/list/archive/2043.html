<EM>&gt;You dont want to do it in silicon. Forget doing all this in silicon. We have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this funky stuff called software. The silicon needs no RDMA support to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sensible work in the API and the underlying OS are sensibly designed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it would be useful to get more quantitative.  I like to
<BR>
think all of us in this discussion are well aware that some level
<BR>
of performance can be achieved in software.  I'm not seeing where
<BR>
&quot;sensibly designed&quot; leads us WRT to OSs, because, if they arent now
<BR>
by whatever definition you are using, it seems pretty academic, as
<BR>
they say.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, data is being received from hardware and software does not
<BR>
get to touch it until it has been stored to some memory.  My 
<BR>
assumption is that the storage system memory is arranged in fixed
<BR>
size pages of disk/file pages.  Without hardware RDMA to the storage
<BR>
level, I believe one requires an extra copy, from whatever the
<BR>
hardware delivers to what the storage system expects.  Either
<BR>
you use twice the bandwidth in the storage system memory system or
<BR>
or else you have a separate memory system for the network, and
<BR>
have software/processor power adequate to copy between at wire
<BR>
speed (with all the associated support facilities for this processor.)
<BR>
&nbsp;Unless there is something wrong with this reasoning,
<BR>
it seems like a cost issue of providing the above hardware resources
<BR>
vs. providing a NIC chip that can RDMA.  
<BR>
<P>My guessitimate is that the software-only approach would be easily
<BR>
10 times more expensive here at the higher speed rates, of 10 Gbps.
<BR>
If there is serious doubt about the merits of real hardware support,
<BR>
we should try to quantify costs further at these speed ranges, IMHO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; You can look at it as a simple way to enable the protocl stack and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; application to completely separate the protocol state machine (defined by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; headers and/or trailers) from the payload.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The two are tied together. You have to parse the TCP option stream to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the ident in the first place. You can't act on the RDMAID until you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have checked the packet is syntactically valid and you've processed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the options including handling the SACK data mixed in with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It might also be fragmented of course.
</EM><BR>
What you need to do &gt;&gt;in the common case&lt;&lt; before processing the RDMA
<BR>
option is relatively simple and a very small portion of the
<BR>
overall protocol state machines, so I presume your comment is
<BR>
asking for more careful wording? Or do you really disagree with the
<BR>
fundamental point?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; As for the vulnerability to attacks with a good size RDMAID and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; imagination you can get the same level of protection as with the TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; sequence number (even a bit better because sequence numbers can be guessed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; from context).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The tcp sequence number protects against ordering errors not against DMAing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crap into the wrong buffer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Different game, different cost if you lose.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
It would help me to have a more careful definition of the types of
<BR>
attacks you have in mind.  In an unsecure network with intruders,
<BR>
presumably I can end up with bad data in the right buffer
<BR>
or right data in the wrong buffer without using RDMA.
<BR>
Do you view we have made things worse, and if so, how?
<BR>
or are you objecting to us not making things better?
