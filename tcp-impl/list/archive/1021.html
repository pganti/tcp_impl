Here are some comments related to this that appeared on the end2end
<BR>
list, January 28, 1997.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you are referring to Windows 95/NT applications (such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the Netscape browser) doing many SYN requests when attempting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CONNECT when the server sends back RSTs, that isn't really a Netscape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bug or issue. It is Microsoft. Their TCP/IP does this. They retry on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SYN that is RST. This is because they also send back RSTs when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backlog for a listening socket is reached and in the early days, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could only set a low backlog which meant that they quickly found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users were getting the ECONNREFUSED status when a server was just too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slow to keep up with the incoming connection request rate.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this go against all existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practice?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How can they then distinguish between an RST in response to a SYN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that means &quot;there is no socket in the LISTEN state&quot; (i.e., the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was never started) versus &quot;the listen queue is filled for this socket&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I try to connect to a server that was never started, how many times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do they resend this SYN, even though each one elicits an RST, and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what frequency?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RFC 793 is pretty clear (p. 37) that an RST in other than the LISTEN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; state means abort the connection, and go to the CLOSED state.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I discussed this with some Microsoft folks when Windows NT first came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out. They said that was the way they intended it to be and that was the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way it would be. Period. (Perhaps they feel big enough to set their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards, it wouldn't be the first time.)
