<P>Craig,
<BR>
<P>It is indeed more complex, as you say.  A group of us at Berkeley/IBM (Padmanabhan, Stemm, Seshan, Katz) did an analysis of Web server traffic based on data from IBM's Atlanta Olympic Games Web server.  One of the things we looked at was the way concurrent connections behaved.  Based on the fairly extensive trace analysis, we showed two things:
<BR>
<P>1. Out of n concurrent connections, if one experiences a loss, on average n/2 of the connections experience a loss within an rtt of that loss.
<BR>
<P>2. The effective multiplicative decrease factor of n parallel connections ranged between 0.6 and 0.75, rather than the 0.5 (or less) that single TCP's show.
<BR>
<P>So, by all accounts, n independent connections are much more aggressive than a single one.  Our paper based on this work appeared at Infocom 98 (the paper also has a number of other results and the design of improvements to TCP loss recovery, and an approach to integrated congestion control + loss recovery across concurrent connections).  You can download the more extended tech report version from <A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hari/papers/csd-97-966.ps.gz">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hari/papers/csd-97-966.ps.gz</A>
<BR>
<P>Venkat Padmanabhan's thesis (in progress) looks at these issues in greater detail and also has comparisons with persistent connections (part of HTTP 1.1), and argues that this approach of integrating congestion control w/ loss recovery is a better approach than persistent connections.  As part of the motivation for these ideas, Venkat uses these Web traces and analyzes how n independent connections behave in the Internet today.
