<P>
Alan,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your feedback.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; tcpRestrictLowPorts  INTEGER { false(0), true(1) }   DEFVAL { false }
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    &quot;Indicates if TCP low ports are restricted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;     authorized servers/socket applications.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Some systems already let you set bitmasks of ports. So this doesnt work
</EM><BR>
<P>This object was intended to indicate weather the low ports are
<BR>
restricted on not. Some systems restrict low port usage to
<BR>
authorized applications. We allow the customer to remove this
<BR>
restriction. My view point on this was that the concept of
<BR>
low port restriction is a common concept. In our implementation we also
<BR>
have a PORT Table to specify which applications are allowed access
<BR>
to which ports. I wasn't sure about representing this in a common
<BR>
way. I assumed that it was more common for implementations to
<BR>
either restrict or not low port usage and that specification of
<BR>
which apps are being allocated to which ports to be too implementation
<BR>
dependent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; tcpConnBytesIn  Integer32
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   &quot;The number of bytes received from IP for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    connection.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We wrap int32's of bytes on a connection in minutes over a fast network
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point. First both tcpConnBytesIn and BytesOut should be
<BR>
Counter32 not Integer32. Second, we could do something similar to
<BR>
what the new ifMib has done and define two new objects:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnHCBytesIn   Counter64
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnHCBytesOut  Counter64
<BR>
<P>The ifMib states:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For interfaces that operate at 20,000,000 (20 million) bits per
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second or less, 32-bit byte and packet counters MUST be used.  For
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interfaces that operate faster than 20,000,000 bits/second, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slower than 650,000,000 bits/second, 32-bit packet counters MUST
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be used and 64-bit octet counters MUST be used.  For interfaces
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that operate at 650,000,000 bits/second or faster, 64-bit packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counters AND 64-bit octet counters MUST be used.&quot;
<BR>
<P>TCP doesn't have an equivalent to a fixed MTU and a packet count
<BR>
so we could just state that implementations that are designed
<BR>
to handle connections transferring at 20,000,000 bits per second or
<BR>
less would be required to only implement the 32 bit counters.
<BR>
Implementations that support connections that can handle data transfer
<BR>
rates faster than 20,000,000 bits/second must implement the 64-bit
<BR>
counters as well. I'm not a fan of Counter64 objects. I've done them
<BR>
for ATM Interfaces. The only benefit you get is that once you
<BR>
implement the 64 bit counters then the 32 bit ones are &quot;free&quot; since
<BR>
they are just the lower 32-bits of the 64-bit ones. Quoting from the
<BR>
ifMib the expect wrap conditions are:
<BR>
<P>&quot;(1) The cost of maintaining 64-bit counters is relatively high,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so minimizing the number of agents which must support them is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desirable.  Common interfaces (such as 10Mbs Ethernet) should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not require them.
<BR>
(2)  64-bit counters are a new feature, introduced in SNMPv2.  It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is reasonable to expect that support for them will be spotty
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the immediate future.  Thus, we wish to limit them to as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few systems as possible.  This, in effect, means that 64-bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counters should be limited to higher speed interfaces.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethernet (10,000,000 bps) and Token Ring (16,000,000 bps) are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fairly wide-spread so it seems reasonable to not require 64-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit counters for these interfaces.
<BR>
(3)  The 32-bit octet counters will wrap in the following times,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the following interfaces (when transmitting maximum-sized
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets back-to-back):
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   10Mbs Ethernet: 57 minutes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   16Mbs Token Ring: 36 minutes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   a US T3 line (45 megabits): 12 minutes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   FDDI: 5.7 minutes
<BR>
(4)  The 32-bit packet counters wrap in about 57 minutes when 64-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte packets are transmitted back-to-back on a 650,000,000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit/second link.
<BR>
As an aside, a 1-terabit/second (1,000 Gbs) link will cause a 64
<BR>
bit octet counter to wrap in just under 5 years.  Conversely, an
<BR>
81,000,000 terabit/second link is required to cause a 64-bit
<BR>
counter to wrap in 30 minutes.  We believe that, while technology
<BR>
rapidly marches forward, this link speed will not be achieved for
<BR>
at least several years, leaving sufficient time to evaluate the
<BR>
introduction of 96 bit counters.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Most of the TCP Connections in my environment won't ever wrap
<BR>
a Counter32 object. Most are Telnet sessions transferring
<BR>
relatively small amounts of data. Even the FTP sessions that I've
<BR>
seen don't get near to a wrap condition. In general wrapping
<BR>
32 bit counters is less likely at the TCP layer than at either the
<BR>
interface or the IP layers.
<BR>
<P>We may also want to consider adding an object to indicate when
<BR>
counter discontinuty occurs similar to ifCounterDiscontinutyTime:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnCounterDiscontinutyTime   TimeStamp
<BR>
<P>The question should be raised so I will raise it myself as to why
<BR>
keep track of byteIn and byteOut counts to begin with. I see two
<BR>
primary reasons:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Accounting - Most customers that I have talked with want an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an accounting record of the amount of data transferred on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a TCP Connection basis. Agreement on a common set of objects
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that can be kept on a connection basis does get us closer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enabling the development of a standard accounting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application or at least identifying the data that should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be kept on a connection basis that other methods than SNMP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are used to collect and store. To really perform accounting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;via SNMP would require definition of several more objects
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depending on the model implemented. I view TCP accounting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself to be out of scope for consideration by this working
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group but can see the need for a standard set of TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connection statistics.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Problem determination - seeing some indication of the amount of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data being transferred does help in problem determination.
<BR>
<P>Another object that we keep that is some what implementation
<BR>
dependent is an identification of the local application that the
<BR>
connection is going to.  This is also very useful
<BR>
in identifying FTP versus Telnet connections for example. Such
<BR>
and object if it exists could be as follows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnLocalReceiverId  OCTET STRING(0..??)
<BR>
<P>An implementation that doesn't know this would just not implement the
<BR>
object or if they were kind return a null OCTET STRING.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; tcpConnRoundTripTime   Integer32
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;   &quot;The amount of time that has elapsed, measured in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    milliseconds, from when the last TCP segment was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    transmitted by the TCP Stack until the ACK was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    received.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But that isnt the round trip time the stack keeps
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not? Is there a better metric that should be represented?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Is there an interest in this type of submission?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Several of your other values blindly assume VJ flow control. This may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;true now but not I suspect in the future.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm only attempting to address what is not plan for potential changes.
<BR>
Thanks again for your comments.
