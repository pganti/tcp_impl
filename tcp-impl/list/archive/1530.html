<EM>&gt; From: Art Shelest &lt;<A HREF="mailto:artshel@microsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902052232.PAA24992@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">artshel@microsoft.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; How would you implement that?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a valid question, however I'd suggest that benefit of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithm is discussed before perceived implementation complexity.
</EM><BR>
<P>In general, I strongly disagree.  Implementation costs are never merely
<BR>
perceived.  Good ideas are a subset of those that have reasonable
<BR>
implementations.  Without a good implementation, talk aobut the
<BR>
wonderfulness of any idea is no better than useless usenet jabber, of
<BR>
which there is no shortage.  Besides, the name of this mailing list
<BR>
is relevant.  That said, all that's necessary to make it reasonable to
<BR>
discuss an idea is a plausible hint that it can be reasonably implemented.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If the recommended value for N is 2, the implementation is trivial,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumes extra 2-4 bytes* per TCB and the overhead is 1-2 extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instructions per send.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *One can store beginning sequence number of the last packet (4 bytes),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or the size of the last segment (2 bytes). If storing last segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size, then Nagle check would change:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; N=1 (today):	SND.NXT &gt; SND.UNA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; N=2:			SND.NXT -SND.SIZ &gt; SND.UNA 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where SND.SIZ is last segment size.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Configurable&quot; implies that sometimes N=1 and other times N=2.  That means
<BR>
that the time costs are at least the following additional instructions,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1   fetch of the switch
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2   test of the switch
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3   branch on the switch's value
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4   fetch SND.SIZ
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5   subtract 
<BR>
<P>Depending on the CPU, you might combine #1, #2, and #3 into 2 instructions,
<BR>
such as a test and a branch, or a fetch and a branch-zero.  The largest
<BR>
costs are probably not the instructions but the primary cache misses and
<BR>
dirtying.  The secondary tertiary cache misses probably don't matter since
<BR>
the entire TCB is likely to be faulted in and dirtied.  Overall, that
<BR>
sounds fairly cheap to me.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Back to the real issue: would allowing N=2 unacknowledged segments 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resolve effects of Nagle/Delayed ACK interaction?
</EM><BR>
<P>How is this idea better than the idea of the draft?  
<BR>
<P>This idea would effectively turn off Nagle for the most common (in my
<BR>
experience) bad code, which loves write-write-read-write-write-read....
<BR>
It would double the number of packets on the wire for such bad
<BR>
applications.  I think that would be Not Good.  Would relaxing Nagle for
<BR>
2 send requests be much different from turning it off entirely?
<BR>
<P><P>Do we agree that I misread the following or it was not tightly phrased?
<BR>
I read it as a proposal for letting the application vary the value of N
<BR>
from 1 to some large number.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Why not parametrize the Nagle?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Instead of &quot;allow only one unacknowledged segment&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allow &quot;allow N unacknowledged segments/bytes&quot; and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; specify recommended range of values.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The N=2 would be similar to current proposal and also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fix the case where application follows the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;small write, small write, read&quot; operation, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which is not addressed by the proposed draft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The N=2 seems like a good choice, because receivers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; typically ACK every other packet.
</EM><BR>
