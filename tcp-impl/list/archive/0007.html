Another thing we discussed while putting together the BOF is what we thought
<BR>
was the best scope for the working group's goals.  We all felt that a line
<BR>
needs to be drawn between implementation issues and research issues.  While
<BR>
there are many interesting and important research questions in how TCP might
<BR>
be modified, a working group focussing on these has a different nature than
<BR>
one focussing on aiding the correctness and performance of existing TCP
<BR>
implementations following existing standards.
<BR>
<P>I think a good place to draw the line is something like: current TCP standards
<BR>
and common practice, as well as TCP extensions that are essentially &quot;done
<BR>
deals&quot;.  This last might have as a rule of thumb something like &quot;has a draft
<BR>
RFC and two independent implementations&quot;.  By this rule, an option like
<BR>
SACK is within scope, but an extension like Vegas is beyond the scope.
<BR>
<P>With that in mind:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1.	BSD stacks have a 75second (ie very short) timeout, which means 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have to hack the kernel to make it usable on amateur radio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.	Not everyone is implementing secure sequence numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.	Most of us are outputting different responses to random ACK frames
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	for a closed socket or listening socket, making stealth scanners
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	too easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5.	TTCP doesnt work well on slow links. If someone does a new TTCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	spec can they lower the 4K initial assumed send size to something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	like min(2*dev-&gt;mtu, 4096).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 7.	How do we handle spoofed 0 window frames, especially when window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	scaling is making the chance of guessing an in window seq far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	higher.
</EM><BR>
<P>These strike me as being in scope.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.	RFC 1337 and Draft-heavans seem to have been ignored by all of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.	Question more than anything else: Has anyone finally proved Vegas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	is good or bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>These strike me as being outside the scope, with (2) being borderline (it
<BR>
would be interesting to know if there are particular reasons why these have
<BR>
not drawn much attention).
<BR>
<P>A last comment: the main theme of the San Jose BOF is administrative.
<BR>
Probably discussion of addressing problems like these (and the ones I talk
<BR>
about) needs to wait until after the BOF.  This would then be on the
<BR>
mailing list and at the next IETF.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vern
