<EM>&gt; From: &quot;Steve Alexander&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:stevea@shastanets.com?Subject=RE:%20Timeout%20in%20FIN-WAIT-2&In-Reply-To=&lt;199808201727.LAA09834@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">stevea@shastanets.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've seen two major classes of customers that want keepalives and want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them to take place at frequent intervals:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	- trading firms that want to detect failure immediately; they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  care about the traffic; they could do it in the app, but they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	- web sites trying to deal w/ Lame-o-matic(TM) clients that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  terminate correctly and would otherwise suffer heavy memory usage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  due to kernel state; I suspect I'm not the only person on this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	  to have encountered such sites
</EM><BR>
<P>Steve knows as well as I, and as well as anyone else with the least
<BR>
real-life experience with busy HTTP servers, that there are many major
<BR>
HTTP sites that would immediately croak without keepalives.  There are
<BR>
many real (read &quot;$$$&quot;) reasons why so many commercial TCP implementations
<BR>
now include mechanisms for &quot;tuning&quot; the keepalive interval to ridiculously
<BR>
(my word) tiny values.
<BR>
<P>I think Steve is wrong to attribute the problem to Lame-O-Matic TCP (tm)
<BR>
(gotta spell it right, or their land sharks might bite).  Even the best
<BR>
TCP implementation has trouble sending a FIN when the human has powered
<BR>
off the modem.
<BR>
<P>It is clearly wrong to talk about &quot;active&quot; TCP connections being a panacea.
<BR>
There are very few TCP applications that involve the notion of &quot;servers&quot;
<BR>
and that absolutely always appear busy to the TCP state machine, where
<BR>
you cannot suddenly halt traffic and have one end think the other is just
<BR>
being very, very slow.  Please name a few among current TCP applications.
<BR>
The trouble with &quot;servers&quot; is that they tend to be passive and not say
<BR>
anything until asked by &quot;clients,&quot; and so tend to fail to notice dead
<BR>
clients.
<BR>
<P>It is also wrong to claim that keepalives waste significant bandwidth
<BR>
today.  Isn't it true essentially all TCP traffic is HTTP, SMTP, FTP,
<BR>
SNMP, DNS, and POP/IMAP?  Which of those has application-layer keepalives
<BR>
and so does not benefit from TCP keepalives?  (ok, maybe FTP in some
<BR>
installations, due to the idle timeout).  Which of those do not involve
<BR>
TCP connections that thanks to the graceless termination of the client
<BR>
cannot appear to be indefinitely alive but quiet connections?  (ok, maybe
<BR>
FTP sometimes).  For which is a TCP connection that is quiet for 5 minutes
<BR>
not a sure fire indication of a dead connection and where a keepalive is
<BR>
not in the least a waste of bandwidth?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; This just confirms Alexander's Law of Network Marketing, to wit: If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to know what features to implement in a networking product for it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be successful, just ask your networking experts what things they think are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stupid and do those first.
</EM><BR>
<P>A more polite way to say that is real life trumps theory and religion.
<BR>
Or maybe, &quot;in theory, there is no difference between theory and practice,
<BR>
but in practice, there is.&quot;
