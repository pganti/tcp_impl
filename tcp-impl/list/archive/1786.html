<P><P>                                    SCOPE
<P>Satellite communications will play an increasingly important role in our
future information-based society.  This is evidenced by the systems
currently  in operation (e.g., DirecTV(TM), DirecPC, GPS, and Iridium) as
well as those to offer broadband, interactive, and multimedia Internet
services around the next millenium (SpaceWay, Teledesic, Astrolink, etc.).
<P>WOSBIS, held three times in 96, 97, 98 in conjunction with MobiCOM,
is a premier workshop on satellite networks and services and provides
a forum for exploratory research contributions on lifting the
technological barriers to achieve innovative satellite applications
and services.  This year, WOSBIS will be held in conjunction with
GLOBECOM'99 and focuses on the communication aspect of satellite-based
information services, more specifically in the network layer, data link 
layer, and medium access sub-layer.  We are interested in work that is 
relevant to both ongoing systems (i.e. current LEO deployment, high 
bandwidth GEO systems, etc.) and future satellite networks. 
<P><P><P>                                    TOPICS 
<P>Papers are solicited in all research and applied areas related to satellite-based 
information systems (including, but not limited to): 
<P><P>     * Datalink technology for satellites, ATM over satellites
     * Resource management and network management
     * Inter-satellite link communications
     * Constellation planning and LEO routing
     * Bandwidth and latency management
     * Quality of Service support in satellite networks
     * Medium Access Control protocols for LEO/MEO/GEO or hybrid networks
     * IP protocols for satellite
     * High-data rate terminals
     * Architectures of high speed satellite networks 
     * Satellite on-broad processing architectures 
     * Algorithms for packet scheduling in satellite networks 
     * Routing protocols in satellite networks 
     * Satellite network control and management 
     * Mobile satellite services 
<P><P>                             SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 
<P>All submissions will be handled electronically. Authors should e-mail 
a PostScript version of their paper to <A HREF="mailto:connors@hrl.com?Subject=Re:%20Deadline%20Extended%20For%20WOSBIS%2099&In-Reply-To=&lt;37D054B1.BF2DA6E3@hrl.com&gt;">connors@hrl.com</A> In order to 
ensure that the PostScript versions of the papers can be printed, 
authors should be careful that their papers meet the following restrictions: 
<P>   - PostScript version 2 or later. 
   - Within 5 to 10 pages. 
   - Fits properly on &quot;US Letter&quot; size paper (8.5X11 inches) 
   - Reference only Computer Modern or standard Adobe printer fonts 
     (i.e. Courier, Times, Roman, or Helvetica); other fonts may be used but must be
     included in the PostScript file. 
<P>It is expected that all accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.
