<EM>&gt;Description of BOF Session
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;--------------------------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The objective of this meeting is to decide how to best address known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   problems in existing implementations of the current TCP standard(s).  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   overall goal is to improve conditions in the existing Internet by enhancing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the quality of current TCP/IP implementations.  It is hoped that both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   performance and correctness issues can be resolved by making implementors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   aware of the problems and their solutions.  In the long term, it is felt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that this will provide a reduction in unnecessary traffic on the network,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the rate of connection failures due to protocol errors, and load on network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   servers due to time spent processing both unsuccessful connections and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   retransmitted data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The BOF is intended to give an overview of the current list of known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   problems and to consider approaches a Working Group could take to improve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   TCP implementations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   There will also be discussion on the proposal to create a working group to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   document the issues.  The charter and other issues surrounding working group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   creation will be discussed in an effort to reach consensus on the best way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to proceed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Attendees should come prepared to discuss both TCP technical issues and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   IETF process issues regarding working group formation, document creation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is all well and good, but thus far a bit too nebulous for my liking. I
<BR>
would ask of anybody who is planning on attending the BOF and who has a
<BR>
specific TCP implementation problem to discuss, that they bring it up, in
<BR>
advance, on this mailing list. In addition, I'd think it considerate if an
<BR>
effort were made to contact TCP implementors not on the mailing list whose
<BR>
stacks will be under discussion at the BOF and on the list - they deserve
<BR>
that courtesy.
<BR>
<P>I, for one, am not fond of surprises being sprung at the IETF, or any other
<BR>
&quot;formal&quot; meeting. It's not only reasonable, but also fair, that
<BR>
implementors or maintainers of stacks with known &quot;problems&quot; be advised in
<BR>
advance that those issues will be discussed in a public forum, allowing
<BR>
them to do their homework and contribute substantively to the discussion.
<BR>
(Not to mention fix problems that perhaps they don't know about!)
<BR>
<P>Please don't misunderstand my concern here - I'm not implying that
<BR>
&quot;suprises&quot; are being planned. But it's clearly to everyone's advantage that
<BR>
each TCP implementation work as cleanly and neighborly as possible, and I
<BR>
welcome any effort that advances that goal. I would simply prefer that, as
<BR>
with most IETF WGs (and the plan apparently is to turn this into a WG), the
<BR>
majority of work be done on the mailing list rather than at a meeting.
<BR>
That's a far more efficient method, it's less likely to ruffle feathers,
<BR>
and it gives the people responsible for the code a chance to get up to
<BR>
speed.
<BR>
