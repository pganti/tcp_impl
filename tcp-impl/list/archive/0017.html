<P>
<EM>&gt;The objective of this meeting is to decide how to best address known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems in existing implementations of the current TCP standard(s).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sometimes it's the lack of details in the specification that cause
<BR>
implementation defects. Of course the line between specification and
<BR>
implementation is not all that clear. Sometimes I wish the original TCP
<BR>
state diagram had been augmented with all possible input to each state,
<BR>
including all combinations of header bits, good/bad sequence number,
<BR>
good/bad ack number... so that us TCP implementors could just check
<BR>
the diagram to do the right thing w/o worrying about recurring bugs.
<BR>
The extreme could even be simply feeding a complete spec to a protocol
<BR>
complier to get the &quot;implementation&quot;, so that all of us can focus on new,
<BR>
less well-defined/understood areas of the protocol.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- The Comer/Lin study on probing TCP implementations.  As I recall, the main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  implementation problems they found regard zero-window probes in SunOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  4.0.3 and Solaris 2.1.  I don't know the status of whether these have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  been fixed (I would certainly guess they have), if someone knows, please
</EM><BR>
<P>Those versions are antique. So any statements regarding bugs on them are
<BR>
likely to be outdated. (We normally ask our customers running older
<BR>
versions to move up to Solaris 2.4 or later, or SunOS 4.1.3 or later if
<BR>
they want to stick to SunOS.)
<BR>
<P>Yes, the zero-win probe bug was fixed a while back in Solaris. The bug
<BR>
had to do with the code failing to recognize zero-win probe state, and
<BR>
use snd_nxt instead of snd_una as th_seq. I'll verify SunOS later.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Solaris 2.3 sometimes only acks if the segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has PSH set or if the delayed ack timer expires.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Mentat-derived Solaris TCP implementation adopted a delayed ack
<BR>
approach where in the streamlined case acks are delayed until either
<BR>
half of the window is filled, or when the delayed ack timer fires. The
<BR>
timer has a default value of 50ms.
<BR>
<P>The delayed ack scheme helps to cut down CPU time in a LAN environment,
<BR>
but is controversial in a WAN (e.g. the Internet) environment where
<BR>
frequent feedback from the other side is considered necessary to keep Van's
<BR>
algorithm functioning. We're still debating what the best approach is...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- Solaris 2.3 does not recognize FIN's set on packets received out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of sequence.
</EM><BR>
<P>True. Our reassembly code currently doesn't record out-of-order FIN, and
<BR>
rely on the remote to retransmit the FIN. This may be fixed soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- SunOS omits generating dup acks for packets received above a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sequence hole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you referring to the latest version (414)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- Solaris 2.3 and 2.4 have a bug in the fast recovery code so they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  don't send packets when they could.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't call this a bug, (is rstevens' &quot;TCP ... fast recovery&quot; a BCP
<BR>
already?) and I don't see how it could happen right away. But there
<BR>
are known deficiencies in this area that will be addressed soon in
<BR>
Solaris, especially concerning a large window size where a burst of
<BR>
packets got dropped:
<BR>
<P>1. Vanilla fast retransmit code can only handle the first dropped packet.
<BR>
It is possible to enhance the code to handle more than one drop w/o
<BR>
resorting to SACK. (Sally Floyd described one in her paper.)
<BR>
<P>2. The timer gets backed off multiple times due to multiple drops from
<BR>
one window. This *bug* probably exists in many implementations.
<BR>
<P>Another problematic area for us has been RTO estimation. With the growth
<BR>
and load of the Internet causing large variation of RTTs, and the ever
<BR>
increasing combinations of bandwidth-delay, the orignal algorithm
<BR>
recommened by Van may need an overhaul.
<BR>
<P>I also have some issues regarding window management and ISS calculation
<BR>
I'll post later.
