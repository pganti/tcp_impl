<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk?Subject=Re:%20Timeout%20in%20FIN-WAIT-2&In-Reply-To=&lt;199808201814.MAA10078@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk</A> (Alan Cox)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; today.  Isn't it true essentially all TCP traffic is HTTP, SMTP, FTP,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SNMP, DNS, and POP/IMAP?  Which of those has application-layer keepalives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most IMAP, POP3 has long idle periods, SMTP has idle periods - with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection cache in sendmail quite substantial ones
</EM><BR>
<P>How long are those IMAP/POP idle periods?  Are they ever 2 hours?
<BR>
If the keepalive interval were 15 minutes, what is the probability
<BR>
that a keepalive would be wasted bandwidth on an idle IMAP/POP connection
<BR>
and what is the probability that it would not be a waste by killing
<BR>
a dead connection?
<BR>
<P>How long is a sendmail connection cached?  I thought it was no more than
<BR>
a few minutes.  The default BSD keepalive interval is 2 hours.  I've never
<BR>
seen sendmail cache an SMTP connection for a fraction that long, but I
<BR>
have seen stale, dead STMP connections.  There is the non-standard sendmail
<BR>
application layer timeout.  If you set it to less than 2 hours, it will
<BR>
fire before the TCP keepalive.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; And the more you lower the timer the more applications fall into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; category of reasons not to do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not understand that reasoning.  Yes, in the best of all possible
<BR>
worlds, it might be that all applications would have keepalives.  I'm not
<BR>
convinced that you would not then complain even more loudly about wasted
<BR>
bandwdith al la the complaints about such things as the Appletalk 15-second
<BR>
babble, but never mind.  The fact is that applications do not have
<BR>
keepalives.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; What Im hearing from you is 90% hot air and 10% &quot;http needs fixing&quot;. Fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fix http
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you propose to fix the many existing HTTP clients to not croak
<BR>
when they receive your new HTTP keepalive?
<BR>
<P>As for hot air ... well ... what have you been telling the people you know
<BR>
who have been having trouble with stale, dead TCP connections for the last
<BR>
15+ years?  (since at least rlogin made keepalives handy)  How have the
<BR>
LINUX systems with merely 1,000,000 HTTP hits/day coped without TCP
<BR>
keepalives?  Since I trust you are not talking through your hat, you must
<BR>
have an effective alternative.  It would be swell to hear your alternative
<BR>
to setting the TCP keepalive interval to values even I find silly.
<BR>
<P><P>It is a fact is that applications today do not have keepalives.  It fits
<BR>
the definition of clinical insanity to act contrary to that fact.  Merely
<BR>
talking as if that fact did not exist is not nececssarily evidence of
<BR>
insanity, but it is not evidence of anything good.
