<EM>&gt; Greetings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I.) I fast recovery, according to rfc2001, after receiving 3 dupacks and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setting ssthresh to cwind/2 and inflating cwind to cwind+3, TCP output
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will transmit the lost segment and on the 4th dupack TCP output will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmit with the new cwind, after increments the cwind. This will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now my doubt is if the retransmitted segment is lost.. then  we have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; count for 3 dupacks, and once again back to step 1 of the fast recovery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithm right ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, no.
<BR>
<P>Let us ignore delayed ACKs. Suppose that there are 10 segments in
<BR>
transit, the first of which gets lost. The next 3 (I think NOT the 4th)
<BR>
generate dup ACKs, and the lost one gets retransmitted. Suppose that the
<BR>
sender goes back to step 1 again. Then after 3 (or 4?) more from the
<BR>
original 10 arrive, then we get fast retransmit again.
<BR>
<P>I guess there are 2 approached.
<BR>
<P>Only go to step 1 after receiving 9 (in this example) dup ACKs for the
<BR>
rest of the data that was in transit. This requires a bit counting,
<BR>
(note that it does not need knowledge of the delayed ACK algorithm,
<BR>
since all out of sequence segments should generate ACKs). Also fast
<BR>
recovery should be speeding ahead for the other 6 dup ACKs.
<BR>
<P>Second appraoch is to admit that Fast Recovery is now confused, and if
<BR>
the retransmitted segment is lost, then rely on time-out / slow-start.
<BR>
<P>I'm bot a SACK guru, but this might have a 3rd method of recovery.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; II.)Next once an  ACK arrives that acknowledges new data, TCP will have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set cwind to ssthresh and then the TCP should go to congestion avoidance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point to be noted here is once congestion is indicated by 3 dupacks we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not reducing reducing the rate at which we are incrementing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cwind, although the cwind itself is reduced to half,  the reason for this 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dupacks tells more then just a packet is lost. 
</EM><BR>
<P>In particular, at tells us that at least 3 other segments got through.
<BR>
<P>But on the other hand when
<BR>
<EM>&gt; new ack arrives cwind is set to ssthresh and the rate of increase of cwind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is reduced more linear and only for every round trip time. I do not see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any justification for this.
</EM><BR>
<P>The assumption is that a segment was lost due to congestion, hence it
<BR>
should slow down. If congestion was not the cause (e.g. a bit error on
<BR>
a  DSL line), then slowing down is not necessary. But how does TCP know
<BR>
the cause?
<BR>
<P>Again SACK guru's might have another approach.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I would say not to reduce the cwind to ssthresh, since network still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capable of accepting the packets.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is the key question. Is it still capable? Other segments got
<BR>
through, but at least one didn't.
