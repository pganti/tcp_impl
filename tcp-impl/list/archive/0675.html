<EM>&gt; From: Vern Paxson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vern@ee.lbl.gov?Subject=Re:%20does%20this%20qualify%20as%20a%20bug?&In-Reply-To=&lt;199708200552.AA02333@zephyr.isi.edu&gt;">vern@ee.lbl.gov</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The check that is done at that trigger can be based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	idle time since last send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	idle time since last receive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 	current window state
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that, in principle, detecting loss of the clock by inspecting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window state is on a par with doing so based on idle time, and perhaps better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I think in practice there's a significant difference.  If &quot;current window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state&quot; is based on how much data has been acked by the most recent ack (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is what I understand you mean by it), then (1) connection performance along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the forward path will now be degraded by conditions along the reverse path
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (due to lost acks), which is not presently the case; and (2) people interested
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;not presently the case&quot; argues against any bug fix.
<BR>
Maybe the forward path should be degraded by conditions along the
<BR>
reverse. Maybe it already is - losing ACKs can cause burstiness 
<BR>
at the source that can overrun buffers on the forward path and
<BR>
cause loss, even when a true paced stream would not have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; in playing tricks with acks (e.g., for bandwidth-asymmetric paths) will lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big if those tricks are considered by the endpoint to reflect loss of the ack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clock.  So I think the window-state approach will be significantly more
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;tricks&quot; that lose ack clocks cause source bursts, and maybe they
<BR>
should be 'punished'. That doesn't seem inconsistent either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; contentious than the idle-time approach.  Since we're trying to go for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minimal changes and minimal contention, our present course should be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; codify/correct the existing idle-time scheme, and not try at this point to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standardize on a different approach.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point is that either approach is 'different' than what is currently
<BR>
done, and that using RTO-since-send may not be any more correct than
<BR>
the current RTO-since-receive in indicating the true problem - loss
<BR>
of ACK clock.
<BR>
<P>The correct fix is to precisely define 'loss of ack clock'.
<BR>
There is certainly leeway in the term 'loss' - lose it a little
<BR>
(be off by 50% when you lose one 'ACK') or lose it a lot (be off
<BR>
by as much as you can ever be, when all data is ACKd and you have
<BR>
sent nothing, i.e., 1 RTO).
<BR>
<P>I'll certainly endeavor to present that continuum, and be conservative
<BR>
in the overhead of computation for the 'bug fix' version - would
<BR>
that be a reasonable path?
