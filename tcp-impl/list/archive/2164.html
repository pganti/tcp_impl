<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; I apologize, the word &quot;reordering&quot; applies to the cases
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; when some order ever existed. 8) There is no order for fragments,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; but that one, which sending host generated.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
<P>This statement is, at best, misleading.  Of course there is a natural
<BR>
order for IP fragments, big-endian like all other network transmission!
<BR>
<P>It seems curious to me that an OS can create the fragments in reverse
<BR>
order without having all the segment in a buffer at one time, since
<BR>
applications certainly do not deliver bytes to the kernel in
<BR>
reverse order.  And if they are all there at one time, you can
<BR>
compute the checksum over it.  Oh, well.
<BR>
<P>The Linux approximation to a trailing checksum is only the latest
<BR>
skirmish in the long-running war over whether TCP trailing checksums
<BR>
would really help performance (assuming lack of brain damage in
<BR>
hardware and software).  One of the early battles in that war was the
<BR>
Berkeley trailer system (BSD was the Linux of the 1980s, remember?),
<BR>
and community consensus eventually killed it as a Bad Idea (see RFC
<BR>
1122 section 2.3.1).  The battle recurs every couple of years on some
<BR>
large mailing list.  No one is every convinced, but the consensus
<BR>
usually seems to emerge that TCP trailing checksums are not very
<BR>
useful for performance.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; BTW, if you have an algorithm that allows you to do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; &gt; 100% accurate Layer-4 classification (without caching) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 100% accurate algorithm, which classifies IP packets using keys
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; contained in payload, does not exist, cannot exist and must not exist.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; It is in contradiction with basic principles of IP.
<BR>
<P>Yes. Protocols that need MF classification had better not do any IP
<BR>
fragmentation.  EG the Int-Serv specs say that explicitly, and they
<BR>
provide mechanisms to inform the sender of the E2E MTU so it can avoid
<BR>
fragmentation.
<BR>
<P>None of this has much to do with TCP, so this discussion is on
<BR>
the wrong list.
<BR>
<P>Bob Braden
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; If such pseudo-router really wants to do this, it must:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 1. Be sure that no other paths from the source to the destination exist.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 2. Gather all the fragments before doing any decisions. The situation,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt;    when different fragments get different QoS must be excluded
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt;    __completely__, otherwise this QoS loses a sense.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt;    BTW, moving closer to the subject, only after this it should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt;    issue them in the same order, which they were received in. 8)8)8)
<BR>
