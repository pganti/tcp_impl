<P>
Please don't accuse me of having anything to do with HTTP/1.0.  It isn't 
<BR>
what I would have built...  And yes, Tim et. al. now understands the mistakes 
<BR>
they made (part of which was that people are using the Web in a very different 
<BR>
way than people first envisioned; the idea that people would be embedding 
<BR>
20 or more embedded small gif's in a page wasn't something that was obvious 
<BR>
4 years or more ago).  With 20-20 hindsight, everything is obvious. So please
<BR>
give them a break.
<BR>
<P>The reality of the Web community is that it doesn't understand TCP. (as 
<BR>
a community, I mean; there are clear exceptions, e.g. Jeff Mogul, who 
<BR>
has been doing great service to try to help straighten out HTTP. ) A slightly 
<BR>
larger minority now understand enough to at least worry about and care 
<BR>
about some of the issues (folks like me, and most other active members of the
<BR>
HTTP working group).
<BR>
<P>Of course you could generalize this non-understanding to most people now 
<BR>
building Internet applications, which is a frightening thought.  I had 
<BR>
dinner with the manager of a significant software company in the 
<BR>
games business.  She does not know what congestion is, and had not heard 
<BR>
of RED.  Even scarier: they use UDP in their games.
<BR>
<P>As to what a protocol for web transport should do, it is something
<BR>
I've been thinking about for a while, and I need to somehow make some time
<BR>
to write down the requirements sometime.  
<BR>
