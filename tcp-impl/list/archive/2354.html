<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You may well believe it.  But what are your grounds?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unpredictability of output of counter mode is part of definition of
<BR>
cipher strength (secrecy).  Many hardware vendors like counter mode,
<BR>
because it is easy to parallelize.  If you have any reasons to believe
<BR>
that there's a systemic weakness in counter mode, it should be made
<BR>
public.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; And 128 bits Ought to be Enough for Everybody(TM).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They said that about 640KB of RAM, too.  I've seen some disturbing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rumblings on the horizon that imply that we may have to worry about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nondeterminstic computers in the (so far only dimly) foreseeable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hoped the pun would be obvious.  My next sentence even mentions 640
<BR>
bits to make it more obvious.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there are several differences that make the implied
<BR>
comparison invalid:
<BR>
<P>* 640KB is a resource.  Moore's law says it'll double every 18 months.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;128 bits is on top of an exponent.  Same law says one would add one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to it every 18 months (we're in the vicinity of 60 or 70--depending
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on algorithm--now).
<BR>
<P>* Increasing the 128 number costs almost nothing performance-wise.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's implementor's choice.
<BR>
<P>* I said that you would continue to gather entropy even after you have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfactory amount.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My point is that you have to assume that the attacker *knows* exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how you're generating the ISNs; all you can keep secret (except in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short term I mentioned), is the entropy you've accumulated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh.  What I meant is that there would be no practical way for the
<BR>
attacker to distinguish between the output of PRNG and true random
<BR>
source, if given two files: one with true random numbers and the other
<BR>
with PRNG output.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your phrasing sounds as though you intend this as some kind of attack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on me as a non-cryptographer.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was not intended as an attack on anybody.  Sorry if it sounded
<BR>
as such.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If so, I consider it flawed, because I am making no claim to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; producing any sort of PRNG; all I am pointing out is that if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't got the entropy, you just haven't got it, and you *are* then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing pseudo-random, rather than really random, values.
</EM><BR>
<P>Didn't I use the term &quot;pseudo-random&quot; all the way?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suppose it comes down to the difference between &quot;infeasible&quot; (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a moving target) and &quot;impossible&quot; (which isn't).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's right.  And performing 2^128 (complex) operations is off the
<BR>
radar screen.
<BR>
<P>My point is that you don't need a lot of entropy to generate good
<BR>
(unpredictable--in practical sense--by an adversary) ISNs.
<BR>
You need *a lot* less than 32 bits per ISN, whether you choose to use
<BR>
a block cipher in counter mode, one-way function to refine the state
<BR>
of entropy pool, a real stream cipher--like arcfour, or some other
<BR>
scheme.
<BR>
<P>Which scheme is the best (meets security requirements for ISN
<BR>
generation purposes and is the cheapest to implement on one's machine
<BR>
or embedded device) is a subject of interesting, but off-topic,
<BR>
discussion.
<BR>
<P>My claim only was that such schemes definitely exist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In any case, tcp-impl probably is not the right place for a crypto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with that.  I only *responded* to (obviously incorrect, or at
<BR>
least very carelessly worded) cryptographic claims.  An earlier
<BR>
message by another author contained assertion that packet arrival
<BR>
times contain 5 or 6 bits of entropy (which seems over-optimistic to
<BR>
me) and that &quot;[e]ven [...] those 5 or 6 bits are valuable&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Of course, they're valuable.  They give one much more entropy than one
<BR>
could ever possibly want for a very good PRNG.  (I would prefer a more
<BR>
pessimistic estimate of the amount of entropy in packet arrival times,
<BR>
such as 0.01 bits per packet, but even that's more than enough.)
<BR>
<P>The actual &quot;how to do it&quot; is, of course, off-topic for tcp-impl.
<BR>
