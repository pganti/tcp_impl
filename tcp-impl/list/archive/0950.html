RFC896 says:
<BR>
<P>[Solution 1:]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is to inhibit the sending of new TCP  segments  when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;new  outgoing  data  arrives  from  the  user  if  any previously
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transmitted data on the connection remains unacknowledged.
<BR>
<P>an alternative would be:
<BR>
<P>[Solution 2:]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is to inhibit the sending of new small TCP segments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;when new outgoing data arrives from the user if the previously
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transmitted data on the connection was small and remains
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unacknowledged (small == less than max. segment size).
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that solution 2 more directly addresses Nagle's concern
<BR>
while disturbing other traffic less.  E.g., consider the case of
<BR>
sending an HTTP reply that has a size of 1.5*mss.  Nagle's algorithm
<BR>
has the effect of sending the first segment immediately but delaying
<BR>
the sending of the second (half-full) segment until the first segment
<BR>
has been acknowledged.  This clearly is unacceptable for any
<BR>
application that uses request/response style communication over a
<BR>
single TCP connection.
<BR>
<P>Solution 2 would avoid this problem but is obviously a little harder
<BR>
to implement.  But apart from that, I don't see anything that's
<BR>
obviously wrong with it.  Of course, one could argue that it's easy
<BR>
enough to disable Nagle, so there might be no point in implementing
<BR>
Solution 2 but, on the other hand, why should we make TCP harder to
<BR>
use than (reasonably) necessary?  It's interesting to note that the
<BR>
description of Nagle's algorithm in Steven's TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol 1
<BR>
reads:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Nagle] algorithm says that a TCP connection can have only
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one outstanding small segment that has not yet been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledged.
<BR>
<P>This is much closer to solution 2 than solution 1.
<BR>
<P>So, apart from implementation complexit/speed issues, are there any
<BR>
reasons not to use Solution 2?
