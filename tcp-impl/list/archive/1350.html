<EM>&gt; However, a simple one-line fix to open the window by the amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data acked (ack - snd_una) should work well always.  The window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would still open exponentially and the time to reach full window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size would still be in the order of RTT*logW, approximately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any reason why it shouldnt be done this way?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think except for the &quot;work well always&quot; part you are right.  I
<BR>
think generally the fix you suggest works well.  It lowers the
<BR>
transfer time (of short connections especially).  The size of the
<BR>
burst of segments in response to an ACK is incraesed a little and
<BR>
therefore, there can be a slight increase in loss.  The real problem
<BR>
comes into play in reno-style recovery, where ACKs for large numbers
<BR>
of un-ACKed data can come in during a slow start after an RTO
<BR>
timeout.  In this case, you very much *do not* want to generate a
<BR>
burst that is basically twice what we generate now.
<BR>
<P>So, a reasonable approach (I think!) is to use a ``limited byte
<BR>
counting''.  Basically, you should increase the window by the number
<BR>
of bytes ACKed, up to some limit like 2 segments.  So, when
<BR>
responding to a correctly behaving delayed ACK receiver you are
<BR>
getting better growth.  But, you are limiting the size of the burst
<BR>
that any ACK can generate to one more segment than is currently
<BR>
allowed in the case of receiving stretch ACK (because of a buggy
<BR>
delayed ACK implementation or ACK loss).  That seems to be a good
<BR>
way to do things to me.
