<EM>&gt;&gt;	After the third packet, the connection is established.  A, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    connection responder, begins transmitting to B, the connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;	initiator.  A quickly sends 6 packets comprising 7812 bytes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;	even though the SYN exchange agreed upon an MSS of 1460 bytes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;	and so A should have sent at most 1460 bytes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would like to see the last sentence in the previous paragraph
<BR>
&nbsp;clarified to something like this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A quickly sends 6 packets comprising 7812 bytes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even though the SYN exchange agreed upon an MSS of 1460 bytes
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(implying a congestion window of 1 segment or 1460 bytes)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;and so A should have sent at most 1460 bytes.
</EM><BR>
<P>As an aside, I observed in your examples that the sending TCP never 
<BR>
sets the PSH bit except in the first segment. I hope the PSH bit is 
<BR>
eventually set and is not shown in your traces because these are trace 
<BR>
fragments and not because the sender is behaving badly. This relates to
<BR>
an 
<BR>
issue I had lately with a TCP implementor that did not set the PSH bit
<BR>
correctly. 
<BR>
The misbehaving TCP did not always set the PSH bit in the last data
<BR>
segment 
<BR>
but still expected that data to be delivered to the application. Our TCP
<BR>
conforms 
<BR>
to RFC 1122 section 4.2.2.2 and stages data until either the PSH bit is
<BR>
set 
<BR>
or the applications receive buffer is filled. If the sender sends all of
<BR>
its data 
<BR>
and does not set the PSH bit, neither of these conditions is met and the
<BR>
connection is effectively hung. They had tested their product with 
<BR>
some UNIX boxes that always pass received data to the application
<BR>
regardless 
<BR>
of whether the PSH bit is set.
<BR>
<P>I do not know how wide spread this problem is but caused us some 
<BR>
considerable grief.
