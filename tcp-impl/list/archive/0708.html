<EM>&gt; I still don't see how this is a problem.  Are you sure the reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the Solaris and Win95/NT stacks didn't work well together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was due to the IWs used?  The Solaris stack has at least one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem that was mentioned a while ago concerning premature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timeouts when the RTT is fairly large.
</EM><BR>
<P>Consider what happens if you have a web server with strict adherence to
<BR>
IW=1 talking to a client which is very good about &quot;only ack every two
<BR>
full-sized segments.&quot; The server will send the first segment of the http
<BR>
response, and will await an ACK from the client. The client will receive
<BR>
the single segment, but will not ACK immediately since it is only one
<BR>
MSS-worth of data, and it has nothing else to send-back the other
<BR>
direction.
<BR>
<P>So, the URL retrieval has a rather nasty wait for the standalone ACK
<BR>
interval in the middle of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I have read of the descriptions of the performance issue
</EM><BR>
between Solaris and Win95/NT, that is the most plausible explanation. 
<BR>
<P>Yes, everything still &quot;works&quot; in that the data eventually gets from one
<BR>
side to the other. It does not work &quot;efficiently.&quot; Since the server
<BR>
waited for the standalone ACK, I think we actually have one *more*
<BR>
segment traversing the network than if the server sent two data segments
<BR>
in the beginning (modulo segment loss).
<BR>
<P>One could argue then that receivers should immediatly ACK the first data
<BR>
segment they receive, to accomodate the conservative IW but again, that
<BR>
is putting more segments into the network, which I would think would
<BR>
make it *more* likely to have packet loss since the average &quot;load&quot; is
<BR>
increased by one packet per connection.
