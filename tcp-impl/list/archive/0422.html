||Put RED at the bottleneck and this becomes a non-issue and then Reno
<BR>
||performs better.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||There is a fix for TCP Reno that (me thinks) is now making it into the
<BR>
||BSD variants (and so should be in SysV variants in 3-5 years and
<BR>
||pee-cees in 5-10?).  With this Reno should also perform better.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||SACK also fixes this.
<BR>
<P>ahem - our Win95 stack is 4.4 Bsd based, has SACK as well as Fast recovery
<BR>
and 1323 big window.  Of course our Win16 and DOS stacks, originally
<BR>
from PCIP code base don't have any of this and are further limited by only
<BR>
being able to queue one out of sequence packet.
<BR>
<P>As for PC's - it seems to me that the vendor pool has dwindled to far fewer
<BR>
than a 2-3 yeasr back...evolution in action or perhaps monopoly in action :-)
<BR>
(fish, fish, as I troll for flame mail from the upper left coast :-))
<BR>
<P>||That's sort of off topic, but...  An off the cuff (also somewhat glib
<BR>
||and possibly wrong) estimate is: workstations - mostly Reno already
<BR>
||though Solaris is something completely different (and a very poor
<BR>
||performer), PCs and Macs - mostly still trying to figure out what fast
<BR>
||retransmit does and why they need it (some notable exceptions, I think
<BR>
||ftp software is well beyond this).  What matters is what the sender
<BR>
||does, so for web access it matters what the server does.
<BR>
<P>:-) :-)  Yup - we have fast rexmit; but the fun part of setting up a
<BR>
good testbed, diddly w/ slow start, rexmit, large window, SACK remains.,..
