This sounds kind of confusing.

<EM>&gt; A lot of the time when we've seen this, it has been due to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misconfiguration in a Cisco router that the local ISP uses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connect to the backbone.  For example, UUNET defaults to using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 4K or so MTU across the HDLC connection.  Cisco boxes have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default 1500 MTU for HDLC connections. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it depends on the interface type. DS3 HDLC connections
<BR>
have a 4470 MTU, f'rinstance. T1s are 1500.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the local ISP box gets changed/replaced/reset/whatever, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration for the connection goes back to the default 1500 MTU,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get the classic black-hole.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not certain why an ICMP frag failure doesn't get sent,
<BR>
let me see if I have the scenario correct:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you connect to a web server that has a 4K path to the back-bone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you advertise a 4K MSS, then it will attempt to send 4K packets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They make it to the far side of the ISP connection, but then get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropped by the Cisco box at the ISP because the packet is too long.
</EM><BR>
<P>Err, you're saying that an the MTU of one side of the interface does
<BR>
not agree with the MTU of the other side of the interface, and because
<BR>
IOS assumes it will never get a packet on an interface that is larger
<BR>
than the MTU for that interface, it has a problem when it receives
<BR>
such a packet?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; UUNET thinks 4K is just fine and sends the packet, the ISP box drops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it in hardware.  Because it doesn't get dropped by IP, no ICMP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message gets generated, and you have a black hole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm...yes, though a counter does get incremented, I think.
<BR>
<P>I don't know whether it is reasonable to explore solutions
<BR>
to this problem that involve layering violations or handing
<BR>
partial packets to IP.
<BR>
<P>Some routing protocols attempt to look for problems like this,
<BR>
e.g. OSPF neighbors comparing MTUs and refusing to neighbor
<BR>
if this happens. Of course, presumably you have an interdomain
<BR>
case where the routing protocol is either &quot;static&quot; or &quot;BGP&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps, if it were not considered too ugly, a BGP option could be
<BR>
added to try to detect this misconfiguration and inform the
<BR>
administrator; this seems easier than trying to mandate a new protocol
<BR>
to check for this, or a PPP option (since so many links use &quot;cisco
<BR>
HDLC&quot;). It seems kind of odd, incidently, that cisco's CDP (&quot;cisco
<BR>
discovery protocol&quot;, which exchanges information about the
<BR>
name/version/ipaddress of routers on common links) fails to include
<BR>
MTU information....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are various tests you can do from your local side to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verify that this is indeed what is happening, and then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can call up and complain to your ISP about having their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware misconfigured.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	1) Ping the web server, if that works:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	2) ping again with large packets (-s 10000)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	3) Try the test to your ISP's router
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	4) try &quot;traceroute www.XXX.com 10000&quot;, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   the return packets are small, that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   succeed where pint -s 10000 won't.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is indistinguishable from an ICMP-filtering-induced
<BR>
PMTU blackhole, though.
