<EM>&gt; &gt; I can see no real evidence they do suffer. Furthermore any ack is implicitly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a delayed ack viewed on anything but a local lan level because its been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; jittered by routers, rerouted via australia and all the other things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; happen to packets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do all packets happen to get rerouted via Australia ? There's a lot of work
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but TCP must assume it could happen. I prefer to route my packets
<BR>
through Pluto myself... :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; that demonstrates the slowness of slow-start for web traffic. Delayed ACKs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; further slow down slow-start. What other real evidence would you ask for ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought that the discussions on IW=2 (or should that be IW&gt;1?) were
<BR>
addressing that issue with delayed ACKs?
<BR>
<P>That being the case, most of the rest of the time, the problems I have
<BR>
seen with applications (such as web servers) has been that they are not
<BR>
making &quot;apropriate&quot; calls to send their data - for instance, sending the
<BR>
http headers and the http data in separate calls to send() instead of
<BR>
one call to writev() or something. 
<BR>
<P>Put another way, all &quot;logically associated&quot; (I am sure there is a better
<BR>
term) data should be presented to the transport at the same time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Secondly your argument makes the oft repeated flawed assumption that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;traffic by volume&quot; equates to &quot;importance and usage by user base&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For one thing I also said that the telnet traffic doesn't form a significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percentage of the number of TCP connections - so my argument doesn't consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volume only. Secondly, your argument in favour of delayed ACKs holds for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'telnet traffic over low speed radio links'. What percentage of the telnet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic on the Internet goes over low speed radio links ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Another consideration is that the delta in processing time between a
<BR>
data packet and an ACK is not necessarily that large. If one were to
<BR>
stop delaying ACK's it would certainly increase the CPU overhead on the
<BR>
end systems. I do not know what the delta is for the &quot;network&quot; but
<BR>
always figure that if a router queue is mesured in packets, one packet
<BR>
occupies a slot in that queue just as well as another.
