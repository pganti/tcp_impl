<P>
There is a problem with RFC2001 bis in regards to the definition of
<BR>
Maximum Segment Size.  The SYN negotiation mechanism gives the
<BR>
impression that MSS is a property of a connection.  However due to the
<BR>
nature of pMTU discovery, it is not assured that the the two ends of a
<BR>
connection agree on the MSS once the data starts flowing.  (The
<BR>
simplest example is two FDDI attached hosts w/ gigabit ethernet in the
<BR>
middle, but in one direction there is insufficient data to trigger pMTU
<BR>
discovery.  Another example is a pair of FDDI attached hosts with
<BR>
asymmetric routing one way through gigabit ethernet somewhere in the
<BR>
middle).
<BR>
<P>MSS is better described as a sender state variable, which may or may
<BR>
not agree with the other end of the connection.
<BR>
<P>As a consequence, algorithms that require the receiver to know the
<BR>
senders segment size can not, in general, be implemented correctly.
<BR>
<P>In the draft, the sentence &quot;Specifically, an ACK MUST be generated for
<BR>
every second full-sized segment.&quot;, is not sufficient to assure correct
<BR>
operation because the receiver can not identify segments which the
<BR>
sender considers to be full sized.
<BR>
<P>I suggest changing the paragraph to note that the classical delayed ACK
<BR>
specification predates pMTU discovery, and is no longer sufficient.
<BR>
Use the simpler, more explicit:
<BR>
&quot;An ACK MUST be generated for every second segment, regardless of
<BR>
size.  (replacing &quot;second&quot; by.....?)
<BR>
<P>Yes, all(?) existing implementation are non-conformant, and yes all(?)
<BR>
can be made to misbehave on real paths.  (In the above FDDI/ethernet
<BR>
examples most receivers send one ACK per six segments.  We have one
<BR>
trace where the receiver was ACKing every 2*4096 Bytes, but the sender
<BR>
was using 512 Byte segments, causing 17 packet bursts during
<BR>
slow-start).
<BR>
<P>This could also be introduced into known bugs.... 
<BR>
<P>I also suspect there is a parallel bug in the receiver side silly
<BR>
window avoidance.....
<BR>
<P>--MM--
<BR>
Sorry for the rushed tone - I travel this afternoon, and will not be
<BR>
at the IETF :-(
