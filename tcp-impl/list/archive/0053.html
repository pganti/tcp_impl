<P>
<EM>&gt; My apologies for not being clear enough.  The scenario to which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was referring  was a client TCP that does not support RFC1122
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half duplex close with RST (it is a SHOULD, not a MUST).
</EM><BR>
<P>Minor nit, but text on page 88 says &quot;MAY&quot;, not &quot;SHOULD&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A host MAY implement a &quot;half-duplex&quot; TCP close sequence, so
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that an application that has called CLOSE cannot continue to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read data from the connection.  If such a host issues a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOSE call while received data is still pending in TCP, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if new data is received after CLOSE is called, its TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD send a RST to show that data was lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This causes the server process to hang if the client closes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection with traffic in the pipe.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still don't understand this. Under no circumstances should a server
<BR>
&quot;hang&quot; and stop (re)transmitting TCP segments if it has data it wants
<BR>
to send or there is unacknowledged data in the pipe. If the client is
<BR>
advertising a zero window, the server is required to periodically
<BR>
probe. If the send window is full, the server must retransmit when
<BR>
ACKs don't come back. If there is unsent data and the send window is
<BR>
not full, the server will send. So the server should never &quot;hang&quot; as a
<BR>
result of not sending TCP segments unless it is broken.
<BR>
<P>If the server is sending segments, but the client is responding to
<BR>
them incorrectly (e.g., by silently discarding them), then the client
<BR>
is broken.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Maybe it only happens for your second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenario: if the server blocks on a write() when a send window of data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is unacknowledged;  if there is enough data to send then the send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window will go down to zero - presumably this ends up blocking the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; write.
</EM><BR>
<P>But normal TCP retransmit timers should take care of this case. The
<BR>
server shouldn't stop transmitting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think the sequence of events is as follows:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  server  is blocked on write()
</EM><BR>
<P>Just because the server (more specifically, the calling application)
<BR>
is blocked on a write call doesn't mean that TCP can stop sending
<BR>
packets (i.e., it still needs to retransmit lost packets in order to
<BR>
advance the window of the send window is full).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.  client closes normally and server ACKs (client in FIN-WAIT-2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and server in CLOSE-WAIT).  No RST because RFC1122 is not followed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.  server never closes
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems to me that the server is never closing because it is not
<BR>
retransmitting unacknowledged data.
<BR>
<P>What am I missing?
