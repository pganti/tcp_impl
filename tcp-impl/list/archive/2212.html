<EM>&gt; &gt; Isn't it possible for a receiver who is retransmitting to us to send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; window updates (when the application at the receiving side picked up new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; data)? Also, when the receiver is retransmitting, not every segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; needs to ACK new data (perhaps we stopped temporarily, perhaps our data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; didn't make it to the receiver), even if it were bidirectional.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I thought about this one. Let me know whether this looks correct: 
<BR>
<P>Assume that segment A is the original one sent by the receiver to us
<BR>
(sender) and it got delayed. Now receiver is retransmitting and it so
<BR>
happens that old (delayed) segment A comes to us. Here are the cases:
<BR>
<P>- New A has a newer ACK (i.e. SEG.ACK &gt; SND.WL2). We don't care what
<BR>
window this segment has. We blindly use it. (The window could have very
<BR>
well been shrunk by the receiver).
<BR>
<P>- New A has same ACK (i.e. SEG.ACK == SND.WL2). In this case, we have
<BR>
two cases:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* New A's SEG.WND &lt; old A's SEG.WND
<BR>
If we were to accept old A first and old A had more window, we won't be
<BR>
accepting New A's ACK information. However, note that this is an illegal
<BR>
case anyway as with same ACK#, the receiver has shrunk the window. This
<BR>
won't be accepted by the existing code. (Only &quot;legal&quot; way to shink the
<BR>
window is to send new data or ACK new data). I hope this one is right!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* New A's SEG.WND &gt; old A's SEG.WND
<BR>
This is perfectly okay, this is a window update and even if we were to
<BR>
accept the old A first and update the window (Note that we would have
<BR>
done this only if old A's window had SEG.WND &gt; SND.WND), we will use the
<BR>
new A's window information and update the window again.
<BR>
<P>- Old A has an older ACK. No problem here. Won't accept the ACK anyway.
<BR>
<P>I think all the cases have been covered.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; The original algorithm accepts window updates if:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; SEG.SEQ &gt; SND.WL1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; OR if ((SEG.SEQ == SND.WL1) AND (SEG.ACK &gt; SND.WL2))
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; OR if ((SEG.ACK == SND.WL2) AND (SEG.WND &gt; SND.WND))
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't think the above is the original BSD checks.  Where did you get it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from?  The BSD check (from actual freebsd code) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        SND.WL1 == SEG.SEQ &amp;&amp; SND.WL2 == SEG.ACK &amp;&amp; SEG.WND &gt; SND.WND
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess you are right. NetBSD 1.41 has the code that I quoted. FreeBSD
<BR>
3.31 has the one that you quoted. Alexy also pointed this out. I missed
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I am still hoping that someone would enlighten me with some kind of
<BR>
reasoning on why the standard BSD code did not use window information
<BR>
contained in retransmissions. i.e. when SEG.SEQ &lt; SND.WL1. I can see
<BR>
only two cases where this can happen:
<BR>
<P>* Retransmission
<BR>
* Out of order segment.
<BR>
<P>Out of order segments are not the issue. I wonder whether there is some
<BR>
kind of really messy case in retransmission which prompted the standard
<BR>
BSD scheme. Or may be I am paranoid :-)).
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>S.R.
