<P>
Dave,
<BR>
<P>If i understand what you did several years ago:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I changed our TCP so that when an application does a single write, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there isn't any outstanding un-acked data, all the new data will go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out (subject to constraints of the congestion window), including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trailing partial packet.
</EM><BR>
<P>you are doing what various other people (Rick Jones, most notably) have said 
<BR>
they are doing.  I.e., Nagle sort of at the output of send() rather than in 
<BR>
tcp_output().  (The BSD code i have, from FreeBSD 2.2.x, does Nagle on *input* 
<BR>
to tcp_output(), rather than as tcp_output() emits packets to ip_output(); 
<BR>
this seems sort of an approximation [possibly less than ideal] to what you are 
<BR>
doing.)
<BR>
<P>I think this is a fine thing to do.  However, i don't think (as you seem to) 
<BR>
that this is the same as what the I-D is proposing.
<BR>
<P>According to the I=D (or, at least the *intent* of the I-D, as Vernon points 
<BR>
out that the english description may not be ideal!; see below for some 
<BR>
pseudo-code), if an application calls send() with 20 bytes, and some MSS-sized 
<BR>
packets are not acknowledged, but no packets &lt; MSS are unacknowledged, then 
<BR>
(consistent with windows) a packet with a TCP payload of 20 bytes will be 
<BR>
transmitted.
<BR>
<P>I think that is *not* what your modification would do.  (Correct me if i am 
<BR>
wrong!)
<BR>
<P>So, the $64,000 question is: now that you (hopefully, if i'm getting better at 
<BR>
explaining it!) know what the modification is, what are your thoughts about it?
<BR>
<P>Thanks,  Greg
<BR>
<PRE>

(eff.snd.mss is RFC1122 terminology.)
<P>Current Nagle:
<P>	if ((available_data &lt; eff.snd.mss) &amp;&amp; (snd.una != snd.nxt))
		don't send;
<P>New Nagle:
<P>	if ((available_data &lt; eff.snd.mss) &amp;&amp; (snd.una &lt; snd.sml))
		don't send;
	else
		snd.sml = snd.nxt+available_data;
<P>(and, code to &quot;pull&quot; snd.sml along, so that it doesn't get left behind if the 
sequence space wraps.)
