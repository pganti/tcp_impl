Hello,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the emerging broadband access networks are asymmetric in
<BR>
nature, i.e., high BW in the downstream direction and low BW in the
<BR>
upstream direction. Examples include HFC, ADSL, Satellite, Wireless
<BR>
access networks. In these systems, TCP Tahoe shows better performance as
<BR>
compared to TCP Reno. This problem has been analyzed by Lakshman et.al.
<BR>
in their paper &quot;Window based error recovery and flow control with a slow
<BR>
ack channel: A study of TCP/IP performance&quot;, available at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://tesla.csl.uiuc.edu/~madhow/publications.html">http://tesla.csl.uiuc.edu/~madhow/publications.html</A>. The reason for this
<BR>
is the following: A single packet loss in TCP Reno (due to buffer
<BR>
overflow or link error) leads to the subsequent loss of multiple
<BR>
packets. As has been well documented, this results in a timer expiry.
<BR>
The chain of events that lead to the loss of multiple packets from that
<BR>
of a single packet, is unique to the way the Fast Recovery algorithm
<BR>
interacts with asymmetric channels. Assuming that the initial packet
<BR>
loss occurs at a window size of W, in a symmetric network, TCP Reno is
<BR>
able to inflate its window size in the Fast Recovery phase and transmit
<BR>
about W/2 new packets. Thus at the start of the next cycle, when the
<BR>
window size is set to W/2, the network is not subjected to a burst of
<BR>
packets. In asymmetric networks on the other hand, due to the slow
<BR>
upstream link, TCP Reno is not able to inflate its window size
<BR>
sufficiently to transmit any new packets. This results in a burst of W/2
<BR>
packets into the network at the start of the next cycle, which leads to
<BR>
multiple packet losses and a timer expiry.
<BR>
This performance problem is of concern to us, and we would like some
<BR>
feedback on what can be done to alleviate it. In particular:
<BR>
&nbsp;- TCP SACK can solve this problem. Is the IETF close to agreeing on a
<BR>
SACK based TCP congestion control scheme? RFC 2018 defines the packet
<BR>
formats for relaying the SACK information to the sender, but it seems
<BR>
there are several proposals on how to modify the basic window
<BR>
increase/decrease algorithms in the presence of SACK.
<BR>
- What is the present state of migration of the major TCP stacks from
<BR>
Tahoe to Reno? In light of the fact that more and more end systems will
<BR>
be at the asymmetric links in the next few years, it may be a good idea
<BR>
to continue with TCP Tahoe until SACK is available.
<BR>
