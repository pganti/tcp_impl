<P>
I've got a problem I'm trying to invent a solution to and I thought I'd
<BR>
ask if there's any past work I should look at, or perhaps it's already
<BR>
been solved and I just don't know it.
<BR>
<P>Most of the hosts on my home LAN are multihomed; I have address space
<BR>
from two different places and I run both subnets over the same house
<BR>
Ethernet.  (Network interfaces are configured to have both addresses.)
<BR>
Sometimes one block of address space is reachable while the other one
<BR>
isn't, and outgoing packets are routed to one of two tunnels (one to
<BR>
each provider of address space) based on which subnet their source
<BR>
addresses fall into.
<BR>
<P>This all works well in normal circumstances.  The problem is with
<BR>
outgoing connections when one block of address space is unreachable for
<BR>
some reason.  All the hosts have their default routes pointing to the
<BR>
off-LAN gateway, but I had to pick one of its two addresses, and the
<BR>
source address for the outgoing connection is always in the
<BR>
corresponding subnet.  When that subnet is unreachable from the
<BR>
destination host, outgoing connections fail even if I do have
<BR>
connectivity to that host via the other subnet.
<BR>
<P>I could deal with the case where a subnet goes completely unreachable
<BR>
with a routing protocol of some sort, perhaps.  But reachability is not
<BR>
always all-or-nothing; depending on where the outage is, which hosts
<BR>
can reach which subnet varies.
<BR>
<P>So I'd like to do something so that outgoing connections for which the
<BR>
application has not specified a source address don't always try with
<BR>
one source address and give up if that doesn't work; conceptually, I'd
<BR>
like to try from all local addresses.  I was thinking of sending out
<BR>
multiple SYNs, one for each local address; as soon as one gets
<BR>
SYN-ACKed, that would commit the local address and SYN-ACKs for the
<BR>
others would draw RSTs.  It does occur to me that I may want to do this
<BR>
round-robin among the addresses, rather than in bursts, to avoid
<BR>
creating unnecessary embryonic connections on the taget host in case
<BR>
both addresses work.  (Of course, they would be torn down quickly in
<BR>
response to the RST, but still.)
<BR>
<P>Comments?  Thoughts?  Prior art?
