||I believe that we still have no clear position from the lawyers, so I'd at
<BR>
||least say that we should not start publically mentioning vendors until we
<BR>
||have some guidelines, which will hopefully be Real Soon Now.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||Speaking personally, I don't feel that knowing the vendor has contributed to
<BR>
||my understanding of the problem in any way.
<BR>
||
<BR>
..
<BR>
..
<BR>
there's another complexity to consider here.  The vendor in question
<BR>
has as far as I can see, given up on TCP.  For the most part, the old
<BR>
TCP on a PC vendor's have given up on the stack business on PC's and
<BR>
are playing out the string w/ their existing customers, doing either
<BR>
very little or nothing at all to their stacks.
<BR>
<P>Ignoring the business and ethical issues here consider that if you
<BR>
identify a complex TCP problem to some of these vendors who still have
<BR>
significant installed based they may not have anyone capable of going
<BR>
into TCP and fiddling correctly with something like connection setup
<BR>
or tear down correctly.
<BR>
<P>Those of us w/ somewhat long memories might recall the TCP market of the
<BR>
late 80's when inferior ports of Bsd 4.2 abounded, had deficiencies which
<BR>
we all coded around.  The Bsd OOB confusion is a perfect example as we
<BR>
at least, and I'm sure most other stacks also, have code to do OOB either
<BR>
Bsd style or correctly.
<BR>
<P>My point here is that we can fix TCP for TCP stacks which are actively
<BR>
under development but we can't ignore the issues of interoperating
<BR>
with and tolerating legacy stacks with legacy deficiencies.
<BR>
<P>L.
