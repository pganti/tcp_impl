<P>
Perry,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If I were a security breaker, I'd love to have that list of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;available over the net. It would make cracking systems ever so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier. Having TCP sequence numbers handed to you without having to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guess would make hijacking connections far simpler than it is now, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instance.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Indeed, I'd say you've just listed virtually everything I'd want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know about the internal state of a remote machine's TCP to make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier for me to attack the system. I couldn't have drawn up a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list if I'd been intentionally trying.
</EM><BR>
<P>You raise a good point that certainly needs to be addressed from
<BR>
several prospectives. First, the set of objects that I think
<BR>
you are referring to would be defined in an optional group and not
<BR>
mandatory. The objects in the mandatory groups are no worst off
<BR>
from a security prospective than those already defined in the current
<BR>
TCP Group. Our intent is not to obsolete the current TCP Group defined
<BR>
by RFC2012 but to define some useful extensions. All MIB internet-drafts
<BR>
must address security in a security section. Typically, remote creation
<BR>
and in general SET support is addressed by stating that implementers
<BR>
do not need to support these objects/functions in a insecure
<BR>
environment. I could add the recommendation that the optional group
<BR>
also not be supported in an insecure network.
<BR>
<P>The SNMPv3 Working Group is planning to come out with a set of standards
<BR>
by the end of this year to provide both a authentication and privacy
<BR>
(encryption) framework. An administrator can define object views
<BR>
with the security QoS defined as appropriate on that view. The
<BR>
security framework that is available to a platform implementing these
<BR>
objects would dictate what gets implemented with the internet-draft
<BR>
providing guidance. The implementation that I worked on has implemented
<BR>
SNMPv2u (RFC1909 and RFC1910) in order to provide some level of
<BR>
protection while waiting for SNMPv3.
<BR>
<P>The second prospective on the issue is exactly how useful this
<BR>
information would be to an entity attempting to steal or misuse
<BR>
a connection. Using SNMP to retrieve this information while
<BR>
looking at the data flow in real-time to attempt to steal or
<BR>
misuse a connection would be challenging for an active connection
<BR>
since I suspect that the data retrieved via SNMP would not
<BR>
correlate exactly to the current connection data flow.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I understand that there are various security layers that
<BR>
have and are being defined within the IETF. For example, IP
<BR>
Security. If the IP layer is protected does presentation of the
<BR>
objects in the optional group till make misuse easier? I haven't
<BR>
been following the security work so don't know. Regardless of
<BR>
this these objects would still fall within the SNMP Security
<BR>
Framework available to a platform implementing any of these
<BR>
objects. Does this address your concern?
<BR>
<P>Regards, Ken
<BR>
