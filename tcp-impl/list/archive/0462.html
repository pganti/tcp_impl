OK - Vern - I got to confess - after 12 years in TCP-dom, 2 implementations
<BR>
of my own and bossing/managing over 4 or 5 others I don't understand
<BR>
the rationales behind the initial constant values like 2MSL in TCP.
<BR>
<P>I have sat around at least a half dozen conference table/whiteboard
<BR>
discussions focusing on the tradeoff's of reducing 2MSL to a lower value;
<BR>
decreasing the fast timeout; etc.
<BR>
<P>Each time I go into my mail archives; go to the same papers, and reread the
<BR>
same RFC sections.
<BR>
<P>I suspect I am not the only person confused.
<BR>
<P>It would be a good thing; it would be a blessing; it would be an immense
<BR>
clarification to define *suggested* TCP constants and explain the rationale
<BR>
behind those constants.
<BR>
<P>L.

<BR>
||&gt; whoa!  The way I read 1122 and friends MSL is to be set to 2 minutes
<BR>
||&gt; and it would take an act of God and Jon postel to change it.
<BR>
||&gt; 
<BR>
||&gt; On rescanning 1122 quickly I see it notes that it was set arbitarily to
<BR>
||&gt; 2 minutes but I seem to recall some serious math around slow WAN links
<BR>
||&gt; leading tyo that 2 minute figure.
<BR>
||&gt; 
<BR>
||&gt; Which perhaps brings up a very interesting topic for the list -
<BR>
||&gt; default values like MSL, initial RTT and backoff array.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||        Yes!
<BR>
||
<BR>
||RSF793 indicates: 
<BR>
||
<BR>
||  For this specification the MSL is taken to be 2 minutes.  This
<BR>
||  is an engineering choice, and may be changed if experience indicates
<BR>
||  it is desirable to do so.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||Which seems to contraindicate:
<BR>
||
<BR>
||        - MSL *MUST* me 2 minutes for TCP according to RFC793
<BR>
||
<BR>
||        - MSL may be changed if experience warrants
<BR>
||
<BR>
||I could see the OS patches using the latter interpretation.
<BR>
||I would hope this is one of the things we could clear up.
