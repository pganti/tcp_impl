Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has anyone tried to estimate the initial value of ssthresh in real
<BR>
networks as suggested by Janey Hoe's SIGCOMM '96 paper ? My concern is that
<BR>
under the presence of delayed ACKs in TCP (which is something that wasn't
<BR>
considered in that paper), the ssthresh value can be highly underestimated.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method suggested in that paper requires measuring the inter-arrival
<BR>
times of three closely spaced ACKs. But if the TCP receiver delays the ACKs,
<BR>
the sender cannot conclusively determine whether the inter-arrival time of
<BR>
any two ACKs is affected by the jitter introduced due to the delay. In fact
<BR>
three closely spaced ACKs would require the receiver to receive six closely
<BR>
spaced segments (assuming it ACKs every two segments) before the spacing
<BR>
between the ACKs is not affected by jitter. But then the six closely spaced
<BR>
segments should have been sent in response to ACKs that weren't affected 
<BR>
by jitter - looks like the chicken and egg problem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the only definite way of getting 3 closely spaced ACKs is to send 6
<BR>
back to back segments at connection startup - which is something that isn't
<BR>
acceptable.
