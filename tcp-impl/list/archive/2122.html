<P>I agree with you irt prev-gen gear, but in those cases the switch path was
<BR>
linear. Out-of-order data is/was due to bad design of something rather than
<BR>
a side effect of &quot;normal&quot; read-and-forward operation. In this case though it
<BR>
seems to be a given that a parrallel switch will most likely cause a
<BR>
significant amount of reordering to occur naturally which is an unplanned
<BR>
phenomenon for TCP.
<BR>
<P>But it also probably depends on the end-to-end bandwidth, too. Reordering
<BR>
probably won't be a problem on end-to-end connections that are only a
<BR>
fraction of the bandwidth, since they won't get into the parrallel switch
<BR>
fast enough to get out-of-ordered by the switch (unless the feeds are more
<BR>
than a fraction, which is not the scenario). On pipes that can be filled
<BR>
with a single flow or which can feed the switch at a significant rate
<BR>
anyway, I bet it knocks performance way down on the effected end-points. In
<BR>
this case, maybe ISPs won't care about reordering but researchers will care
<BR>
very much. Then we'll just need faster all over again.
<BR>
<P>Such a product would likely end up becoming self-selective in its market.
<BR>
Maybe technically the product can reorder data all it wants, but the market
<BR>
won't want a product that does it.
