<P>EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!
<BR>
<P>Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
<BR>
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
<BR>
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
<BR>
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
<BR>
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
<BR>
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
<BR>
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
<BR>
&quot;spidering&quot;. By simply feeding the spider program a starting
<BR>
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
<BR>
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
<BR>
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
<BR>
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
<BR>
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
<BR>
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!
<BR>
<P>A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
<BR>
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
<BR>
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
<BR>
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
<BR>
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
<BR>
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
<BR>
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
<BR>
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!
<BR>
<P>For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
<BR>
in New York all you would do is:
<BR>
<P>1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
<BR>
the words doctor(s) and New York
<BR>
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
<BR>
http://...  for instance it might look like
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s">http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s</A>)/?New+York
<BR>
3) Press the START button
<BR>
<P>THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
<BR>
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
<BR>
you want.
<BR>
<P>The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
<BR>
day or all night while you are working on important things or
<BR>
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
<BR>
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
<BR>
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
<BR>
the end of the day!
