<EM>&gt; &gt;Bad security makes no sense; TCP has no security (SSL does, so does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;IPSEC, but then _THEY_ should carry that info, or not. not TCP :-) It'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be inappropriate to send a RST in response to failed SYN authentication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(to counter DOS attacks); silence is the best response there anyway.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not disagreeing with you. Both of these are examples of bad codes. They are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just two examples of the codes that have been suggested on this list by some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people. I'm guessing (since I don't know the reason why they were initially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested) that they were probably inspired by the text in page 67 of rfc793.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes...  Yes...  That's exactly correct, and I should never have let these
<BR>
appear on the list that I gave to Ian, because to my knowledge these have
<BR>
never really been active.  Code was written ten years ago to hypothetically
<BR>
implement the precedence and security checks suggested on page 67 of RFC 793.
<BR>
The code was never actually compiled into anyone's product, and no longer
<BR>
exists.
