&nbsp;you have a shot at having a successful marketing
<BR>
&nbsp;experience with the internet.

and millions of prospects. 
<BR>
<P>It's true what the old saying says  - &quot;no one 
<BR>
ever sees a candle that's hidden under a basket.&quot;  
<BR>
It's the same for your web site.  
<BR>
<P>*  Is your web site hidden under a basket?
<BR>
<P>*  Can prospects easily find your web site?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From one business person to another, let me
</EM><BR>
ask this question - If prospects can't find your 
<BR>
web site, then how do you expect to make any
<BR>
money from it ???  You Can't....
<BR>
<P>You'll be amazed at how easy it is to immediately
<BR>
get the kind of exposure your web site needs to 
<BR>
be successful.
<BR>
<P>Who uses our service?
<BR>
<P>Universities, Colleges, Medical Facilities,
<BR>
Government Facilities, Trade Bureaus, Chambers
<BR>
Of Commerce, Travel Agents/Agencies, An Enormous
<BR>
Variety Of On-line Shops Selling Everything Kind
<BR>
Of Product, Service, Or Information You Can Imagine,
<BR>
Hotels, Motels, Bed &amp; Breakfasts, Vacation Spots.
<BR>
The List Goes On And On...
<BR>
<P>A good question you might be asking yourself is
<BR>
&quot;Why should I pay these guys even 5 cents to
<BR>
do this? Can't I do it myself?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The answer is - sure you can but let me
<BR>
ask you this - 
<BR>
<P>Isn't your time worth more than 5 cents???
<BR>
<P>It sure had better be !!!
<BR>
<P>You know as well as I that your time is
<BR>
best utilized managing your business and not
<BR>
sitting at some keyboard hours upon hours
<BR>
trying to save less than 5 cents for each  
<BR>
submission. See how it's kind of crazy to try
<BR>
to tackle this on your own.  It's just not 
<BR>
cost effective to try to do this yourself.
<BR>
<P>Not to mention that you will be totally nuts 
<BR>
within 2 days of attempting to do this and 
<BR>
you'll be pulling your hair out and wanting
<BR>
to throw your keyboard across the room :-)
<BR>
<P>Another good question you might be asking is
<BR>
&quot;OK, this almost sounds too good to be true.
<BR>
I've seen other companies that charge several
<BR>
hundred dollars for this type of service and
<BR>
you're telling me that you can do it for only
<BR>
$39.95?&quot; What's the catch ???
<BR>
<P>There isn't one...
<BR>
<P>We have invested thousands and thousands of 
<BR>
dollars into state-of-the-art equipment and custom
<BR>
software which makes this all manageable.  As a 
<BR>
matter of fact, we are so fully automated that we 
<BR>
can handle several thousand submissions per day.
