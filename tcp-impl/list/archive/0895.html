Hi,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is there some work that demonstrates how important it is to delay 
<BR>
the ACKs in the Internet ? 
<BR>
<P>The disadvantages of delaying the ACKs appear to be the following:
<BR>
<P>i) The slow-start and congestion avoidance at the sender get slower as these
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not increase the window based on the bytes acknowledged, but rather on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of ACKs received (which are halved).
<BR>
ii) A retransmission timeout of less than 200ms cannot be used as it would 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lead to spurious retransmissions when the receiver delays the ACKs for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200ms (at least for the BSD implementations).
<BR>
iii) When TCP options are used (such as the timestamp option), a TCP receiver 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would ACK every 3 segments as shown in [1].
<BR>
iv) Some other unfortunate interactions due to delayed ACKs are demonstrated in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2].
<BR>
<P><P>The advantages of using delayed ACKs can be enumerated as follows:
<BR>
<P>i) Enables the piggybacking of ACKs on any data segments that might be sent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the receiver.
<BR>
ii) Reduces the number of ACKs in the network as well as reduces the number of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACKs that the sender needs to process.
<BR>
<P><P>As most of the traffic on the Internet is web traffic, it is questionable how
<BR>
beneficial is i). Most of the HTTP traffic consists of short requests by
<BR>
clients that are served by servers - so there's not much opportunity for
<BR>
piggybacking here. FTP starts up two different TCP connections for the two
<BR>
sides of data transfer, so there's not much piggypacking opportunities for 
<BR>
FTP traffic too. I'm not aware of any work that demonstrates how important is
<BR>
ii). At least reducing the ACKs in the network doesn't appear to provide much
<BR>
benefit as ACKs are typically quite small in size as compared to data segments.
