<P>
<EM>&gt; * In not too much time at all, I'll have hundreds of httpd processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   on your machine stuck waiting for this damned CGI script, and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   processing any real requests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Your customers get pissed off.
</EM><BR>
<P>In case it wasn't blindingly obvious to everyone, the punchline is:
<BR>
<P>Because you're using T/TCP, I can submit these 1-packet probes with
<BR>
totally random (or very pointedly non-random) source IP addresses, so
<BR>
you can't filter them out by source.  I can randomize the data in the
<BR>
query a bit and make it very difficult -- perhaps even impossible --
<BR>
for you to filter out the requests based on data.
<BR>
<P>In short, I can potentially make it impossible for you to prevent this
<BR>
attack from happening.  And the reason I can do this is because you're
<BR>
using T/TCP.  If you were using TCP, this wouldn't be possible.
<BR>
<P><P>I *think* we could actually fix this, by using some sort of exchange
<BR>
in the first connection (which always does a full 3WHS to initialize
<BR>
the connection count) and a hashing mechanism similiar to RFC-1948 to
<BR>
ensure that future SYN-data-FIN packets came from the same source as
<BR>
the initial connection request (or at worst a snooper in between).
<BR>
This would effectively restore the `security' (in this case, really
<BR>
the *accountability*) of normal TCP.
<BR>
<P>I haven't worked out the details, but it seems emminently doable.
<BR>
<P><P>And I think that's enough mail for this morning.
<BR>
