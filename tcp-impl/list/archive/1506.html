<P>] Yes. Your definition of MSG_PUSH seems to exactly match the PUSH bit in
<BR>
] the TCP spec (FINALLY!!!!!!!).
<BR>
<P>As I tried to say earlier, it's almost 20 years too late for such
<BR>
considerations.  The PUSH bit irrevocably means what it now means,
<BR>
as useless as that might be.  Or in other words, you can't starting
<BR>
tommorrow saying that a write without the MSG_PUSH option will be
<BR>
arbitrarily delayed.  It might have been really swell to have the
<BR>
MSG_PUSH bit in ~1981 when sockets were defined, but since none of
<BR>
us are of the Wishful Thinking School of Engineering, ...
<BR>
<P>And one writev() is vastly better than two writes, no matter how many
<BR>
bits you add to the API.   You could consider the BSD definition of
<BR>
the PUSH bit as a stupid tax.  People who use two write()'s when one
<BR>
is possible are likely to to have designs and code that won't notice
<BR>
the additional slow down from Nagle+delayed Ack.  (From my experience,
<BR>
that's emperically true.)

<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The name doesn't matter, e.g. MSG_NDELAY would work as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   - I bet that most applications that now need to turn set TCP_NODELAY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;      would still need to use TCP_NODELAY.  In other words, what could you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;      do with MSG_PUSH that you could not do more efficiently (i.e. with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;      fewer CPU cycles) with writev()?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First, the combination of modifying Nagle and adding MSG_PUSH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is what I would recommend, not just MSG_PUSH.  The combination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the two would eliminate most of the need for TCP_NODELAY.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe so, but I've doubts.   My current application would still need
<BR>
TCP_NODELAY or would set MSG_NDELAY on every write, which I think amount
<BR>
the same thing on the wire.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Secondly, yes, sending the transaction in a single writev() is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by far the prefered method.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that the MSG_NDELAY bit would be a nice supplement for writev(),
<BR>
when where it is hard to get all of the buffers together for a writev().
<BR>
It would also be a better way than TCP_NODELAY to patch code from the many
<BR>
people that don't realize why write-write is a bad idea.   TCP_NODELAY is
<BR>
a big hammer unless you really know there are no write-write sequences in
<BR>
which the first write should be delayed.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The usual need for using TCP_NODELAY is to get around Nagle, due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to it interacting poorly with delayed acks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) With the modification to Nagle, then for a single request sent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in a single writev(), no matter how large the request, there would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    be no need for TCP_NODELAY.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) If a request is sent via multiple writes, then using MSG_PUSH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    on the last write will eliminate the need for TCP_NODELAY.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) If an application is sending multiple requests with a separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    write for each request, with or without the Nagle change, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    trailing data will get delayed.  Using MSG_PUSH on the last write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    will eliminate that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point is that rather than bypassing Nagle in all instances,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using MSG_PUSH you can bypass Nagle at the specific points where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you need to.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really like the Nagle algorithm, but how many applications really need
<BR>
it today?  Among carefully written applications (i.e. use writev or at
<BR>
least never more than 1 write/request) that might use MSG_NDELAY, how
<BR>
many would not get exactly the same results by TCP_NODELAY?
<BR>
<P>The biggest trouble with MSG_NDELAY is the same as with writev().
<BR>
You'd have it where you don't really needed it (e.g. BSD systems)
<BR>
but not where you do need it (e.g. winsock).
