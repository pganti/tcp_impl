<BR>
======================
<BR>
We invite you to participate in the International Network Conference 2002

both academia and industry to present and discuss the latest advances in
<BR>
networking technologies from both research and commercial perspectives.
<BR>
<P>The first event, INC ‘98, was held in Plymouth in 1998, attracting an
<BR>
international audience and papers on a wide range of topics. This success
<BR>
was continued with INC 2000, with delegates attending from 18 countries.
<BR>
Feedback from conference delegates at both events was extremely positive
<BR>
and it is intended that INC 2002 will be similarly successful.
<BR>
<P>The 2002 conference will again take place in the historic city of
<BR>
Plymouth, on the south-west coast of England. The event will be held over
<BR>
three days, encompassing presentations delivered by researchers from

across the international community. Social events and a conference banquet
<BR>
will also take place, giving an opportunity to exchange state of the art
<BR>
results and advances in both formal and informal settings.

<BR>
the British Computer Society, Orange Personal Communications Services
