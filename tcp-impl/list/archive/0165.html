<P>
<EM>&gt; I would like to see the last sentence in the previous paragraph
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  clarified to something like this:
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds good, I've added this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As an aside, I observed in your examples that the sending TCP never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sets the PSH bit except in the first segment. I hope the PSH bit is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually set and is not shown in your traces because these are trace 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fragments and not because the sender is behaving badly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the sending TCP in that trace does indeed set PSH now and then.
<BR>
I just poked through a couple hundred traces I have lying around
<BR>
(representing maybe six different TCPs) and all of them set PSH at
<BR>
least once.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The misbehaving TCP did not always set the PSH bit in the last data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segment but still expected that data to be delivered to the application.
</EM><BR>
<P>This looks like it's okay.  RFC 793 (section 3.7, page 41) says:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CLOSE user call implies a push function, as does the FIN control
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flag in an incoming segment.
<BR>
<P>and I didn't see wording in RFC 1122 overruling this, though maybe I missed it.
<BR>
<P>Rich Fox wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have seen a number of implementations that seem to depend on the PSH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>If this means that they won't ultimately deliver all of the data if
<BR>
the last segment doesn't include a PSH, then that definitely seems worth
<BR>
documenting.  (A bit hard to show from a trace, I guess ...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... I would like to see the RFC amended to say the PSH bit is advisory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on when to deliver data to the app but a stack should deliver data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regardless of the PSH bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe this should instead be worded in terms of: stacks must ultimately
<BR>
deliver data even if they don't ever receive a PSH?  (Because in 793,
<BR>
beginning of section 2.8, it sounds like PSH is mandatory and not advisory.)
