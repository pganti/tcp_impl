<P>
I have a question about delayed ACK policy that is widely used in
<BR>
current TCP
<BR>
implementation and makes the receiver send an ACK per two packets.
<BR>
<P>my question is that if out-of-order packet is received but it is next
<BR>
expected one, then the receiver should delay corresponding ACK ?
<BR>
<P>for example, if the sender experiences mulitple packet drops in a
<BR>
window,
<BR>
then timeout occurs in TCP Reno. the sender already send packets
<BR>
between &quot;snd_una&quot; and &quot;snd_max&quot;. TCP starts its slow-start again.
<BR>
At the receiver's view, it receives some packets between &quot;snd_una&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;snd_max&quot; and it expects the next packet (&quot;next_&quot;) will be the packet
<BR>
that has
<BR>
seq number of &quot;snd_una&quot;.
<BR>
To make it easy, let's thinks the worst case. The receiver receves only
<BR>
one
<BR>
packet that has seq number of &quot;snd_max&quot;. Then the sender in its
<BR>
slow-start
<BR>
send packets burstly from seq number of &quot;snd_una&quot;.
<BR>
At this point, the receiver should use delayed ACK ?
<BR>
<P>I think that the receiver should not delay ACKs because the packets are
<BR>
out-of-order. But it seems that some implementations delayed the
<BR>
correponding ACKs because they test only whether the received packet has
<BR>
<P>&quot;next_&quot; seq number.
<BR>
<P>Is that right? I am not convinced.
<BR>
Any helps are welcome.
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
