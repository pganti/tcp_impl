The following occurred to me:
<BR>
<P>1.It would be interesting to know how many independent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP implementations exist, and the rough proportions in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which they are represented.  Once the derivation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an implementation is known, one can deduce a lot about the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of bugs it has (e.g. anything derived from BSD 4.4 is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to have similar bugs).
<BR>
<P>2. It used to be the case that there were bugs in common implementations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that you had to workaround (e.g. BSD4.3 did a strange telnet echo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;negotiation to ascertain whether the peer was BSD4.2 or BSD4.3- maybe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not a violation but surprising if the peer TCP is neither).  Since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;these are impossible to find except by rigorous interoperability
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;testing, it would be enormously useful to have these listed.  OK,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the idea is to get the buggy implementations fixed but in the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;short term it is a good idea to workaround flaws in e.g. BSD TCP/IP.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this is what we're discussing, but adding a workaround
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if it exists would be nice.
<BR>
<P>3.  Most of the bugs mentioned are protocol issues or end-to-end
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance issues on a single connection.  Is it within scope to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mention scalability issues, e.g. supporting large numbers of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connections in TIME-WAIT?  This would reduce some of the problems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with RSTs.  I tried to summarise the issues, mostly researched
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Jeff Mogul (and the Sequent SIGCOMM paper) in section 5.1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of draft-heavens-problems-rsts-03.txt.  
<BR>
<P>4.  Are there bugs that crop up persistently in independent TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations?  e.g. mishandling of queued data for transmission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when a close is issued?  These would point to the most difficult
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issues.
<BR>
<P>5.   Should we separate buggy implementations of algorithms and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inappropriate (or debatable) algorithms?   
<BR>
<P>regards
<BR>
