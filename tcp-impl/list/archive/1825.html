<P>
My mail delivery has been rather untimely (I also think I may not have
<BR>
received all my messages) so I'm not quite sure where the discussion is,
<BR>
but, here are another couple of comments I hope are relative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;            ....   I understand that it's probably too late to change the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; DiffServ spec now, but perhaps we can learn something from this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If it is not too late to change RFC 793, then how can it be too late to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;change RFC 2474?  Does the fact that RFC 793 is about 10 times older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and at least 10,000,000 times more widely implemented really mean that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;RFC 2474 is the one that cannot be changed?   SHEESH!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Let's agree that there is a problem, and set out to solve it with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minimum overall pain, but with the onus for bearing most of any unavoidable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pain on DiffServ.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well excuuuuuusssssse me.  DiffServ made a potentially catastrophic blunder
<BR>
here and should be changed if it makes sense.  What I really meant to say
<BR>
was that I singularly do not have the power to retract the current
<BR>
pre-standard existing DiffServ implementations that are causing problems nor
<BR>
the power to change the existing spec.  In the mean time, I have to fight
<BR>
the fires caused by those existing DiffServ implementations and succumb to
<BR>
the redefinition of the TOS byte to ensure that clients TCP connections are
<BR>
not abnormally terminated, thanks to DiffServ.  By conforming to the
<BR>
redefinition, I also have to pray that I don't break any of their
<BR>
applications that may be dependent on the precedence bits. 
<BR>
<P>Here's what I think should formally happen:
<BR>
<P>- The IETF should retract the current standing of the DiffServ spec.
<BR>
- The proposed ID, &quot;TCP Processing of the Precedence Field&quot;, should be
<BR>
bandied about and debated.
<BR>
- The outcome of the debate should determine the standing of the proposed ID
<BR>
and current DiffServ spec.
<BR>
<P>Let's try to &quot;put the horse before the cart&quot;.
<BR>
