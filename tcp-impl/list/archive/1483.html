<P>
<EM>&gt; Because you just have to make one change to the kernel code instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of many changes to all applications which do bulk data transfer.  Moreover,
</EM><BR>
<P>Back-up a step here - I thought that the problem being fixed here was
<BR>
for request/response applications. From the original rfc txt:
<BR>
<P>begin quote:
<BR>
<P>The interaction of delayed ACKs and Nagle
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a TCP has more application data to transmit than will fit in one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet, but less than two full-sized packets' worth of data, it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will transmit the first packet.  As a result of Nagle, it will not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transmit the second packet until the first packet has been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledged.  On the other hand, the receiving TCP will delay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledging the first packet until either i) a second packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrives (which, in this case, won't arrive), or ii) approximately
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100ms (and a maximum of 200ms) has elapsed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sending TCP receives the delayed ACK, it can then transmit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its second packet.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a request-response protocol, this second packet will complete
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either a request or a response, which then enables a succeeding
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response or request.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note two (related) bad results of the interaction of delayed ACKs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Nagle algorithm in this case: the request-response time may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be increased by up to 400ms (if both the request and the response
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are delayed); and, the number of transactions per second is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substantially reduced.
<BR>
<P>end quote.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps my definition of bulk data transfer application is differnet,
<BR>
but I take that to mean a very large (&gt;&gt;&gt; MSS) quantity of data
<BR>
transfered unidirectinally (eg FTP). Given that, I'm not sure that there
<BR>
is any problem with such an application and the current Nagle algorithm
<BR>
is there? Enough data accumulates from the small sends to make full-MSS
<BR>
segments and away they go.
<BR>
<P>Now, in separate email I was discussing that first quoted paragraph with
<BR>
Greg. I'll try to paraphrase it here :) First, the paragraph again:
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a TCP has more application data to transmit than will fit in one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet, but less than two full-sized packets' worth of data, it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will transmit the first packet.  As a result of Nagle, it will not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transmit the second packet until the first packet has been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledged.  On the other hand, the receiving TCP will delay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledging the first packet until either i) a second packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrives (which, in this case, won't arrive), or ii) approximately
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100ms (and a maximum of 200ms) has elapsed.
<BR>
<P>My understanding of &quot;the way things are supposed to work&quot; :) is that if
<BR>
that one-and-a-fraction MSS-worth of data was presented to the TCP in a
<BR>
single &quot;send&quot; that all of it should go out without delay. And yes, that
<BR>
could mean a series of 1460,1,1460,1 segments traversing the network. I
<BR>
demonstrated that being the case with a quick netperf TCP_RR test with
<BR>
&quot;-r 1461,1&quot; - if the paragraphs description was correct, I should have
<BR>
only gotten ~5 transactions per second (200 ms delayed ACK), but I got
<BR>
several hundred.
<BR>
<P>My further understanding (going further in the quoted text above) was
<BR>
that if the application presented the data to the TCP in two (or more)
<BR>
&quot;sends&quot; and that the remote could only reply when all the data arrived,
<BR>
that the application was essentially broken - it was presenting
<BR>
logically associated data to the TCP in separate &quot;send&quot; calls when it
<BR>
should have been presented in a single send (perhaps a gathering send).
<BR>
<P>Depending on how that application structured its sends. I'm not sure the
<BR>
proposed change: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Nagle algorithm modifies this as follows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a TCP has less than a full-sized packet to transmit,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if any previous less than full-sized packet has not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet been acknowledged, do not transmit a packet.
<BR>
<P>would actually &quot;fix&quot; things. For instance, a (broken IMO) application
<BR>
that sent a 2048 byte &quot;request&quot; as a pair of 1024 byte &quot;sends&quot; would
<BR>
still encounter the delayed ACK. As I am guessing would an application
<BR>
dribbling data out through stdio (say a web plug-in or something)
<BR>
<P>Now, there may still be sufficient cases of reasonable applications that
<BR>
are not broken, but still &quot;suffer&quot; from Nagle, but I'm not sure (yet -
<BR>
I'm sure someone else will point some out :) what they are. _Maybe_
<BR>
something to do with pipelined http requests generating sub MSS
<BR>
responses?
<BR>
<P>The idea presented in the draft about an explicit flush mechanism was
<BR>
interesting, though it would be a coupled change in both the
<BR>
application(s) and the kernel.

-- 
today, an ACK is just as expensive to the server as a data segment...
these opinions are mine, all mine; HP might not want them anyway... :)
feel free to email, or post, but please do not do both...
