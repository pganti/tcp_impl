<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Why not use an MSS of 65535? ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not a good idea.  If you loose one, you loose them all. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another item is that if you send a huge TCP packet, nothing can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acked until the whole thing arrives at the remote system.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can really kill VJ slowstart/congestion avoidance.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but it sure helps if you're running MByte windows on local pipes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The reason I see to use a smaller MSS is safety or conservatism.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I agree with that.  The only question is how conservative?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Old code said &quot;576, if not local&quot;, that is too conservative.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a spectrum:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MSS=576.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MSS=MTU of interface.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. MSS=max(MTU's of non-local interfaces).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MSS=9180, 16K, 32K, 65335 or some other special number.
<BR>
<P>We all agree #1 is too conservative and at least the 64K end of #4
<BR>
is too risky.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Using the MTU of the outgoing interface is the best conservative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's also quick and easy to compute and more well defined than #3.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;          There are only two reasons why I'd argue for a larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MSS:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	1) The routing could change, and switch to a larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   MTU path.  If you set MSS too small, you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   take advantage of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	2) Asymetric routes.  If my path out goes through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   ethernet, but his path back goes through the FDDI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	   then when I stick in 1500, he's hosed.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- when routing is subject to much change, performance is generally
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less of an issue than having things work.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- topologies complicated enough for assyemtric paths are usually
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(but not always) either missconfigured (e.g. interface metrics)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or complicated enough to make working a bigger question than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; PMTU discovery were perfect, there would be no reason to use anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; except MSS=64K.  In the real world, if you use a larger MSS than your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hosts that don't support PMTUD aren't supposed to send packets larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than 576 into the outside world, irregardless of what was received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the MSS option.
</EM><BR>
<P>If that 576 were changed to something reasonable for 1990, such as
<BR>
1500, then that sentiment would be influential.  But since 576 is so
<BR>
tiny, that old injunction is and will be widely ignored.  Hosts that
<BR>
don't have PMTU discover use subnetsarelocal or allnetsarelocal=1.
<BR>
I think in the real world, there are 2 main choices, PMTU discovery
<BR>
or *arelocal.  The third, using 576, is minor.
<BR>
<P>Besides, 576 doesn't help the bridge problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you advocate hamstringing all of your FDDI connections, on the off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chance that some clueless person bridges FDDI&lt;-&gt;ethernet?  Gag.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course I oppose using 1500 on FDDI.  Instead, I the persistently clue
<BR>
challenged about their personal problems.  (I also years ago added a
<BR>
ridiculous-MTU.switch so that they can make things work after we've
<BR>
discussed their foolishness.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; So provide a switch, if you must, but at least default to allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FDDI to use FDDI size packets...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, at least when the path is known to start at 4352.
<BR>
<P>The question is whether it is reasonable to tell the TCP peer to use
<BR>
4352 when you know the peer's packets are likely to be fragmented onto
<BR>
your Ethernet (except when one of those wonderful bridges that neither
<BR>
fragment nor send ICMP messages is involved, so the packets are just
<BR>
dropped).
<BR>
<P>Those bridges are almost enough of a peeve of mine to advocate such a
<BR>
practice, since it would make them useless except when the those buy
<BR>
them configure their hosts to use 1500 instead of 4352 over FDDI.  You
<BR>
wouldn't want every TCP connection to suffer enough timeouts to invoke
<BR>
a PMTU Discovery blackhole mechanism.  I suspect that at most vendors,
<BR>
including SGI, I'd be overruled.
<BR>
<P><P><P>You'd be doing the world a favor if in the document said that any
<BR>
FDDI-Ethernet bridge that does not fragment is junk.  That would at
<BR>
least make it easier to argue with such the dupes of Cabletron and NPI
<BR>
salescritters that for years claimed that just dropping big IP/FDDI
<BR>
packets is just fine, causing neither performance nor interoperability
<BR>
problems.  (Yes, I understand NPI and Cabletron have started to do
<BR>
something to fix their products, but only after publishing a lot of
<BR>
'interesting' statements.)
