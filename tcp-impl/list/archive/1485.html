Folks:
<BR>
<P>Perhaps this is a dumb question and has been discussed before, but is
<BR>
there any value in having TCP know a bit about what the application is
<BR>
doing? This might be considered a protocol layering violation. Has
<BR>
anyone implemented this kind of scheme?
<BR>
<P>I'm thinking one could have logic that says &quot;delay ACK unless all data
<BR>
delivered to application&quot;. I don't mean moved into the queue, but a read
<BR>
was actually waiting and all data delivered or on its way to the
<BR>
application. Of course, you would ONLY not delay if you received a small
<BR>
segment (in the case where you believe the sender may be doing the Nagle
<BR>
algorithm). One could also consider including an explicit &quot;full&quot; window
<BR>
update with this immediate ACK.
<BR>
<P>A small change to this logic might be to only avoid delaying the ACK
<BR>
if the application can accept more data (ie, all has been delivered and
<BR>
there is still a read outstanding) - you know the application wants more
<BR>
data!
<BR>
<P>One could also implement this that when a read is queued by an
<BR>
application, if a delayed ACK is pending on the connection (and the last
<BR>
segment was small), send the ACK now.
<BR>
<P>This of course is wasteful if your round trip time is long (since the
<BR>
delay ACK time is insignificant in that case). So, perhaps this would
<BR>
only be turned on if the round-trip estimate is &quot;short&quot;.
<BR>
<P>However, the cost is also small as if all data was read, the application
<BR>
must be ready for the data and why not expidite delivery of more. Also,
<BR>
for a fast network, it is unlikely that an application could keep up
<BR>
with network speeds for long and hence this wouldn't trigger that often.
