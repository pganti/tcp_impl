<EM>&gt; Now lets make it clear that I find keepalives as evil as the next person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and wish they could be vaporized from the face of the earth.  However
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Windows-Land (and perhaps some of the Microsoft watchers on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might chime up also) we have all these somewhat shall we say - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network-inexperienced - application programmers who do not understand either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network programming or the concept of multiple CPU synchronization.
</EM><BR>
[...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; We tell them our keepalive is 2 hr's and they protest.  Loudly.  Often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a mutual customer is involved and competitive products with shorter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keepalives are mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've had several apps where it was critical to know a TCP connection
<BR>
was dead or jammed, and fast. This was for a trading floor application
<BR>
where the TCP connection was sending out quote updates -- a bad place
<BR>
to lose on getting information! If the TCP to one server went down, I
<BR>
wanted to know that I needed to switch to the other.
<BR>
<P>I had a simple way to do this. My application protocol included a &quot;are
<BR>
you there&quot; noop function. I'd send an &quot;are you there&quot; on a timer that
<BR>
got reset if I got traffic (i.e. I only sent &quot;are you there?&quot; queries
<BR>
if the line was idle), and if I got nothing back in a moment or two, I
<BR>
switched.
<BR>
<P>In other words, I did keepalives at the application layer, where,
<BR>
IMHO, they belonged.
<BR>
<P>I don't understand why people expect TCP to provide this for them. One
<BR>
size does *not* fit all for these things. I needed to switch in
<BR>
seconds if I got a network outage. Most people have no such
<BR>
requirement and would be hurt by switching in seconds.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After a few years of this, perhaps 7 or 8 years back,we provided a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration parameter by which a user could set our keepalive to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any value they wanted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, and then you find yourself with some of the things on a machine
<BR>
taking too long to fail, and some gratuitously failing all the
<BR>
time. This doesn't work. One size does NOT fit all.
<BR>
<P>You want your network backup program to last through a midnight router
<BR>
reload. You want your network market quote service to switch off if
<BR>
you don't get data for seconds. These are NOT the same requirement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My point, which I perhaps have belaboured a bit too long, is that keepalive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timers are not just a stack issue, but also an issue of educating application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developers as to what keepalives are used for and what they should not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be used for.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the reasons keepalives make me upset is because apps guys DO
<BR>
NOT understand them, and start to think the stack should take care of
<BR>
this for them, which it probably shouldn't.
<BR>
