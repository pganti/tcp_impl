<P>[ end of thread on moving the burden of TIME-WAIT from web servers to

seems appropriate ]

<P><EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This has the effect of making the server-side active close convert into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'active' at the client, and effectively distributed the storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of old TCBs at heavily-loaded servers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with all of the suggestions so far is that they require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a change at the client end.  If this is really a problem (I recall a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jeff Mogul paper not too long ago that actually plotted the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connections in the TIME_WAIT state on a busy Web server) then I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's better to work on the problem at the server.  Trying to get all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different clients that are out there (most are PC stacks, I'd guess) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implement something new sounds impossible.
</EM><BR>
<P>You make an interesting point - it's always easier to improve the
<BR>
quality of servers, which must be more robust, support more connections 
<BR>
etc.  On the other hand, the idea of the TCP implementors' WG is to improve TCP
<BR>
implementations; from the BOF it appears that it is the implementations 
<BR>
that generally act as clients that need the most improvement.  Sounds 
<BR>
like a dual approach of fixing the server side first if possible, but 
<BR>
making recommendations for the clients, might be a good idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When BSDI upgraded their stack this past summer to make their Web server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;faster&quot;, they moved all the connections in the TIME_WAIT state onto their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own queue, to get them out of the tcp_slowtimo() function.  I'd bet that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the majority of the CPU savings right there.  (I've always thought that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BSD tcp_{slow,fast}timo() functions must be one of the biggest bottlenecks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a busy system.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  PCB lookup costs have been analysed (the Sequent paper on
<BR>
efficient demultiplexing &amp; Jeff Mogul's &quot;Case for Persistent HTTP&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;Network Behaviour of a Busy Web Server and its Clients&quot;). I wonder about 
<BR>
the effect of timer traversals of thousands of PCBs, especially on the 
<BR>
cache.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If memory is then a problem (I think the BSDI code still saves the inpcb{}
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the tcpcb{}; 384 bytes if my memory is right) then I'd bet you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; save a lot less state information for the TIME_WAIT state, similar to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; savings they obtained with the changes to help with the SYN flood attacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this fall.  If you could reduce the amount of state information down to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 32 bytes, then you have increased by one order or magnitude the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these TIME_WAIT connections for a given amount of memory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeff Mogul's conclusions in his SIGCOMM paper were that memory occupancy
<BR>
was not a problem (less than a Mbyte of state for TIME-WAIT connections 
<BR>
in a busy web server) - at least for a web server.  I think you could get 
<BR>
the state down to about 13 bytes (1 address + 2 ports + some bits) and 
<BR>
reduce timer search costs at the same time, by reducing the granularity 
<BR>
of the TIME-WAIT expiry timeout. If the burden of TIME-WAIT is moved to 
<BR>
the client (or for applications where the client enters TIME-WAIT), this 
<BR>
might be an idea.  Certainly it is a fairly easy way to free up around 
<BR>
0.5 Mbyte on a web server.
<BR>
<P>The perceived costs of TIME-WAIT are still too high, if people are 
<BR>
reducing the MSL from the (low) 60 seconds down to 10 seconds, or zero; 
<BR>
in addition it looks like a lot of RSTs are being used to avoid it 
<BR>
(5-10% on the DEC election server: see <A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/traces/netstat">ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/traces/netstat</A>).  
<BR>
I think this should be flagged as a concern of the TCP implementors' 
<BR>
working group.
