<P>
<EM>&gt; Looking at the trace I sent, you will note that message 1 packet #3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is shorter than MSS and has the PSH set, while message 2 packet #2 is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shorter than MSS and does _not_ have the PSH set.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In both cases, this occurs at the CRLF CRLF between the SMTP headers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the body.  Presumably, multiple application calls to the stack.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In either case, had the API allowed the application to set PSH,
</EM><BR>
<P>...nothing in particular would have happened, even if the application
<BR>
had chosen to take advantage of it.  To cure this particular lossage,
<BR>
you need to (a) have the stack _not_ set PSH at the end of every
<BR>
application write, and (b) if the stack has a timeout that would make
<BR>
it send non-PSHed data anyway, ensure that the application does the
<BR>
first body write soon enough that this timeout doesn't trip.
<BR>
<P>The case of mesasge 2 packet #2 is stranger because of the missing PSH;
<BR>
if the stack sends a less-than-MSS packet without PSH, then either it's
<BR>
sending into a restricted window[%] or it's broken because it drained
<BR>
its available data without setting PSH...assuming of course that
<BR>
something (such as path MTU discovery) hasn't caused it to lower its
<BR>
effective MSS for the connection.  I'm considering only the case of
<BR>
message 1 packet #3 here, and I don't have the trace itself at hand.
<BR>
<P>[%] Even if the sending stack does silly window avoidance, such packets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be generated; if the peer insists on advertising a tiny window,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you've got to eventually decide it's not being silly and send a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tiny segment into it.
<BR>
<P>I will note that if the stack _does_ time out and send the last header
<BR>
packet on its own initiative, this can cause the time between that and
<BR>
the first body packet to be arbitrarily short, because the application
<BR>
can write the first body data an arbitrarily short time after this
<BR>
timeout occurs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is a documented case where the lack of a PSH ([...]) caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; additional network packet load and concomitant additional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retransmissions.
</EM><BR>
<P>More likely it's the stack forcing a PSH at the end of each application
<BR>
write; less likely than that, it could have been the application being
<BR>
slow.  Allowing the application layer to set PSH wouldn't help unless
<BR>
accompanied by having the stack not supply a PSH at the end of every
<BR>
application data write.
<BR>
