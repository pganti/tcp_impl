<P>]It seems somewhat dangerous and unneccessary. ...
<BR>
<P>] What most vendors Im aware of do is to compute the sequence space as
<BR>
]
<BR>
] 	counter+hash_function(src,dst{, port, port})
<BR>
] ...
<BR>
<P>Yes, RFC 1948 should be added to that list of RFC's.  Besides describing
<BR>
the New Offishal IETF method of generating initial sequence numbers,
<BR>
RFC 1948 talks about reasons to space them.
<BR>
<P>There is some distinctly lame Security Checking Software out there that
<BR>
the suckers--oops--network administrators and purchasers are using that
<BR>
purports to detect insecure initial sequence numbers.  Its documentation
<BR>
evidently mentions RFC 1948 and so has made RFC 1948 a check-list item
<BR>
around the world.  Never mind that according to its vendor, this wonderful
<BR>
software does not detect some dubious initial sequence numbers, nor that
<BR>
it's test apparently consists of sending a burst of back-to-back SYN's on
<BR>
the local LAN, and then looking for constant, non-zero deltas.  If the
<BR>
bad guy is on your LAN, then worrying that he might guess initial sequences
<BR>
numbers is as perceptive as worrying about getting fleas by petting a
<BR>
rabid wolf.
<BR>
<P>As far as I can see, there would be no problem (other than cost) with what
<BR>
Microsoft is alledged to be doing if they guarantee that all initial
<BR>
sequence numbers are &quot;sufficently far apart.&quot;   &quot;Smaller&quot; is as good as
<BR>
&quot;larger&quot;, provided the delta is large enough so the probability of
<BR>
collision is small enough.  Incrementing with a clock is one way to get
<BR>
&quot;far apart,&quot; but there are plenty of other permutations of the natural
<BR>
order of the most significant ~16 bits that would work just as well. 
<BR>
Of course, no one with a clue about the problem would bother with a simple
<BR>
permuation such as an LCRN.  You must assume the bad guy has access to
<BR>
your source and can get enough samples from any running system to solve
<BR>
any non-crypto random number generator.  However, if you were willing to
<BR>
keep enough state and spend enough cycles, you might use a dynamic mapping
<BR>
of the most significant bits.  You could be to keep cycling your secure
<BR>
random number generator until it delivers a number sufficiently different
<BR>
from recent choices.  It's not what I'd do, but maybe Microsoft is
<BR>
expecting faster computers than those I've written initial sequence number
<BR>
code for.
