<P>
It looks like two separate threads have now merged into a hybrid.  Here's
<BR>
my take on untangling it.
<BR>
<P>One issue is the problem of senders not setting PSH even when they have no
<BR>
more data to send.  It appears the consensus is that that's simply broken,
<BR>
and should be documented as an implementation problem.
<BR>
<P>A quite separate issue arose when I floated the idea of amending the TCP
<BR>
spec so that receivers MUST NOT routinely discard above-sequence data,
<BR>
rather than SHOULD NOT.  This led to interesting discussion of scenarios in
<BR>
which, due to memory constraints, the receiver might need to discard
<BR>
above-sequence data, and that has evolved into discussion of whether it's
<BR>
okay to shrink the offered window, instead of advertising more window than
<BR>
you actually have buffer.  This latter discussion looks like it may drift
<BR>
into general window-shrinking issues; that's fine, but I don't want to lose
<BR>
sight of the original question about failing to retain data.
<BR>
<P>So let me ask:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Do we have agreement over the sender-should-set-PSH issue,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it's an implementation problem we should document?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Can we resolve the failure-to-retain by using wording that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receivers must not &quot;routinely&quot; fail to do so?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This come about because for the implementation where I observed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this, as far as it could tell it simply never bothered retaining
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above-sequence data, even though it had plenty of memory.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect this was to simplify the implementation, but it seems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear that because of the bad congestion properties of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behavior, it should be fixed.  So I'm trying to separate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;routinely&quot; doing so from &quot;occasionally&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a different way to put it is that a TCP must have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanism in place that allows it to retain a full window's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth of above-sequence data, without delving into specifics
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of when that mechanism might not be exercised.
<BR>
