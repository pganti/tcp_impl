<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The case where the interaction between Nagle and delayed ACKs

<EM>&gt; &gt; becomes a problem is when the receiver can't do anything until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it gets the data that hasn't been sent yet, defered by the Nagle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; algorithm.  The Nagle code is waiting for the ACK, and there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no return data on which to piggy-back the delayed ACK, so you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wait for the delayed ACK timer to go off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However 4.4 BSD explicitly checks and does not delay an ack for a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller than MTU sized frame. So this appears less of a problem anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if Im reading my copy of Stevens right
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know exactly what you are looking at, but unless I am missing
<BR>
something, it doesn't behave that way for me...
<BR>
<P>In fact, just the other day, I ran into a cute problem doing some simple
<BR>
web server benchmarking.  I was getting 5 requests/sec.  That number alone
<BR>
made me suspicious; 200ms*5 = 1s.
<BR>
<P>What was happening is a BSD bug (cf. TCP/IP Ill vol3, section 14.11) was
<BR>
causing the client (FreeBSD 2.2) to put a write() of between.. erm...  101
<BR>
and 208 bytes into two mbufs instead of a mbuf cluster.  This means it was
<BR>
sent in two packets.  Slow start wasn't the issue since I was using
<BR>
persistent connections, but Nagle on the client combined with delayed ack
<BR>
from the server was causing the client to delay sending the second packet
<BR>
in the request until the ack arrived for the first packet, 200ms later. 
<BR>
Hence almost exactly 5 requests/sec. 
<BR>
<P>The server was also FreeBSD 2.2; unless something has changed from 4.4BSD
<BR>
there, it does delay acks for frames smaller than the MTU. 
<BR>
<P>I guess I can be thankful that most HTTP requests are more bloated than
<BR>
208 bytes or the client could disable Nagle to work around it.  Slow-start
<BR>
still could pose a problem though.
