Sure, excuse me for not being more specific.
<BR>
<P>There's two specific areas of interest to me
<BR>
<P>- There's no TIME-WAIT protection after RST.  This just needs
<BR>
documentation as I don't think anyone wants to change the TCP state machine
<BR>
to fix this.  I've been meaning to write this up for submission
<BR>
as an Informational RFC.  I guess once that's done, if there
<BR>
was any interest in fixing the issue, it could be discussed then
<BR>
<P>- There is the potential to include an error code with a RST
<BR>
(RFC 1122 permits data in the RST segment), and the Mentat TCP
<BR>
implementation has been using this for many years (so we can
<BR>
be confident that TCP implementations do not do anything nasty
<BR>
when they receive a RST with data).  There's no standard
<BR>
for such error codes and I wonder if implementors would be
<BR>
interested in proposing a taxonomy.  I know that such an error
<BR>
code would be very useful in diagnosis.  With an API the
<BR>
application layer could exchange error codes, though probably
<BR>
someone will point out that there is a better way of doing that..
<BR>
<P>Additionally issues with RSTs came up in RFC 2525 and every now
<BR>
and then they crop up (see the two RST-related issues in the RFC).
<BR>
An awful lot of HTTP connections terminate with a RST (P-HTTP
<BR>
fixes this but I wonder if other applications will depart from
<BR>
the norm of graceful termination in both directions).  RSTs
<BR>
used to be considered as rare error conditions but maybe
<BR>
this is no longer true.  
<BR>
<P>Worth a discussion if anyone out there is interested?
<BR>
<P>ian
<BR>
<P>PS as an aside, what mechanism does SCTP have to avoid TIME-WAIT
<BR>
(a question for Vern)?

<EM>&gt; I am in Pittsburg, and interested in what the issues might be, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that invitation was a bit nebulous - and in any event it would be good

<EM>&gt; to get the issues on the list so that they get wider visibility.
