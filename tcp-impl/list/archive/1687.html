<EM>&gt; From: &quot;Eric A. Hall&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ehall@ehsco.com?Subject=Re:%20alternative%20PMTU&In-Reply-To=&lt;199903230506.WAA03533@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">ehall@ehsco.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, what I'm thinking is that instead of sending a series of recursive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probes through the network (which don't get returned, or which get eaten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by ICMP-hostile devices, or which don't provide any useful info), just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the end-node return an option that says &quot;hey fragmentation has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occurred and this is the biggest fragment that I got.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>But once again, the biggest fragment that a host received has no useful
<BR>
relationship to the path MTU.  Please consider the implications of the
<BR>
8-byte granularity of IP fragments.  Because of the 8-byte granularity,
<BR>
it can be impossible for a router to generate a fragment that is as
<BR>
large as the MTU allows.
<BR>
<P>Consdier the possibility that the router with the smallest MTU in the path
<BR>
might not do not fragment stupidly.  What if the MSS is 2048, the PMTU is
<BR>
1500, and the largest fragment far host receives is 1024?  Your scheme
<BR>
would incorrectly declare the PMTU to be 1024.  
<BR>
<P>Consider load sharing a TCP connection with MSS=4312 (FDDI) over two paths,
<BR>
one with PMTU of 1500 (Ethernet) and the other with PMTU 4352 (FDDI).
<BR>
Your scheme would falsely declare the PMTU is 4352.
<BR>
<P>Also as I said before, your notion does not support UDP.
<BR>
In practice, UDP often needs PMTU discovery while TCP usually does not,
<BR>
because of the TCP MSS option.
<BR>
<P>All of those casees are handled correctly by the current mechansim RFC 1191.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; It is a lot easier to deal with the one message that is explicit than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to deal with many messages of many different flavors that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily tell you anything even when they do succeed (the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design of using DF and hoping for informative errors).
</EM><BR>
<P>Please take time to read RFC 1063 and RFC 1191, and see that there
<BR>
are not &quot;many messages of many different flavors&quot;, but only two.
<BR>
Please also notice that one of those two flavors contains the actual,
<BR>
accurate value, unlike the hopelessly inaccurate value of your proposal.
<BR>
<P>Consider the 1988 date of RFC 1063, and consider the likelihood that
<BR>
support for the second flavor that contains all of the accurate information
<BR>
is practically universal today in reasonable routers.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; One downside to the one-shot model is that the remote end-point HAS to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support the option if it is going to be relied upon. Otherwise you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just keep sending fragmentable data and never get a response saying &quot;got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frags.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and that issue was one of the design constraints on RFC 1063
<BR>
and RFC 1191.
