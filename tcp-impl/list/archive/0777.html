<P>
Jerry,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The important point, that is not explict in RFC 1122, is that the URG flag
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be made visible to the receiving side without delay.  Forcing out a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segment with data that would not otherwise be sendable (which may or may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include the data at the urgent pointer) is a way to accomplish this, but I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not sure that it is a good idea to provide this back-door mechanism to bypass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all send controls.  I believe that the right thing to do when the sender TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is presented with outbound urgent data at a time when the send rules preclude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; putting a segment on the wire is to generate a zero-length segment with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; URG flag on and the urgent pointer set.
</EM><BR>
<P>A zero length segment can not be reliably delivered by TCP since it can not
<BR>
be acknowledged.
<BR>
<P>I believe t_force in BSD allows TCP to send one byte i.e. it might not
<BR>
send the urgent byte but it will at least send a segment that contains
<BR>
the urgent pointer. This allows the reliable delivery of an urgent notification
<BR>
to the other application.
<BR>
<P>A case that does work on BSD derived systems is to have an
<BR>
application send data until it gets an EWOULDBLOCK (i.e. TCP is flow
<BR>
controlled) and then send an urgent byte. With BSD derived sender
<BR>
and receiver this causes an immediate SIGURG on the receiver even though
<BR>
TCP is flow controlled by the receiving application.
<BR>
<P>I don't know of any applications that depend on this behavior (because
<BR>
Solaris 2.0 through 2.5.1 didn't do this) and I know it is somewhat
<BR>
painful to implement this and BSD SIOCATMARK behavior correctly in
<BR>
an asynchronous (streams based) protocol stack. But in any case, I haven't seen
<BR>
anything (except the BSD source :-) that document this behavior in sufficient
<BR>
detail.
<BR>
<P>Would it be useful to nail down this detailed behavior?
<BR>
A lot of the behavior is tied to the socket API and not to the TCP
<BR>
protocol specification.
