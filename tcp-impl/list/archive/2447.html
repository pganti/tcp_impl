&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi all,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the product that I'm currently working in, we have clients and servers.
<BR>
The server has a leader-follower pattern of threads which monitor the
<BR>
connections or data that come as the result of fds that fire from the select
<BR>
set. (the fd could be listener fd for which a new client connection comes
<BR>
when it fires or a old fd with some data).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the question is?.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the server runs out of FDs, I remove the listener FD from the select
<BR>
set as I don't want to talk to any client. Coming to the TCP/IP internals, I
<BR>
believe any new client connections will queue up in the queue with backlog
<BR>
mentioned by listen() system call until reaped by accept() call. If queue is
<BR>
full, any new clients will timeout as they cannot contact the server. I
<BR>
believe the time in this case is 75 seconds which is the establishment
<BR>
timer. Now what I want to know is if the server never issues an accept()
<BR>
call to take these connections off the queue (this will happen because we
<BR>
pulled out the listener FD from the select set and so it won't fire), FOR
<BR>
HOW LONG will these connections stay in the queue. I presume any client that
<BR>
sends data to the connection which is in a ESTABLISHED state and queued at
<BR>
server, it starts a retransmission timer and no response after 5 or 9
<BR>
minutes (recommended default of 12 retrasmissions) will elicit a RST from
<BR>
the client side to the  server side. As a result of this, the server TCP/IP
<BR>
will remove the established connection from the queue.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the time related to retransmission timer?.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any help greatly appreciated.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a nice day,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravi.
<BR>
