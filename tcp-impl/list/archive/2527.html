<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
As a dot.com professional you know that it is essential to your teams' 
<BR>
success to advertise your web site, business, product, service, or your 
<BR>
organizations' cause to the masses. You also know that your marketing and 
<BR>
advertising budget limits your options.
<BR>
<P>If you are a Fortune 500 corporation, you have the advantage of being able to 
<BR>
book 30 second TV spots during the SuperBowl. Most of us are not in that 
<BR>
position though. Besides, did you know that something on the order of 92% of 
<BR>
TV viewers run to the washroom at commercial breaks during the program, 
<BR>
thereby missing the expensive commercial spot.
<BR>
<P><P>Q: Of all the various advertising mediums which do you feel is most effective,
<BR>
&nbsp;in cases when you require your prospect to remember your telephone number or 
<BR>
web address?
<BR>
<P><P>Let's outline and agree on a list of the main advertising and marketing 
<BR>
mediums first:
<BR>
<P><P>- Television Commercial
<BR>
- Television Infomercial
<BR>
- Internet Banner Ads (paid for on a click-through basis)
<BR>
- Internet Banner Ads (paid for on an impression basis)
<BR>
- So-Called opted-in email list rental and broadcast
<BR>
- Radio Commercial
<BR>
- Print Media (Newspapers, Magazines)
<BR>
- Print Media (Hand-Outs)
<BR>
- Trade Shows
<BR>
- News or Media organization story or profile on your project
<BR>
- Affiliate Links
<BR>
- Signage
<BR>
- Telemarketing
<BR>
- Direct Mail 
<BR>
- Broadcast Fax (not personalized to its recipients)
<BR>
- Broadcast Fax (personalized and to the Attention of its recipients)
<BR>
- Targeted Broadcast Email (personalized or not)
<BR>
<P><P>Now consider the effectiveness of each advertising choice, remembering that 
<BR>
in many cases your audience must still remember a telephone number in order to 
<BR>
contact you.
<BR>
<P><P>Q: Which is the least costly and most effective?
<BR>
<P><P>E-mail marketing works! Why? There are many reasons, but primarily because 
<BR>
people are focused on their monitors while checking their e-mail. Totally 
<BR>
focused. In addition, they have a hard copy of your ad on their hard drive, 
<BR>
and it is simple for them to forward the ad to their friends and
<BR>
associates as well.
<BR>
<P><P>You can tell your story with more words and target your list to particular 
<BR>
types of recipients or geographical areas. We offer some of the best delivery 
<BR>
and bulk e-mail prices on the Internet. Bulk e-mail can get you the best 
<BR>
exposure on the net. What makes this kind of advertising so effective is the 
<BR>
fact that you go to the potential customer. Not like search engines or print 
<BR>
ads that the potential customer has to do all the searching.  Dollar for 
<BR>
dollar bulk e-mailing is also the most economical.  We do all the mailing for 
<BR>
you. You just provide us with the ad!  It's that simple!
