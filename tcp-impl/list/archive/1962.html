<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; Please help me understand what RFC2581 intends regarding the value
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; advertised in the MSS option when other options (e.g., Timestamp) are going
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; to be used.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; Suppose the MTU is 1500 bytes, and after the 3-way handshake a host is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; going to be sending on each segment 12 bytes of TCP options:  Timestamp
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; plus two NOPs.  RFC879, &quot;TCP Maximum Segment Size,&quot; says &quot;THE TCP MAXIMUM
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; SEGMENT SIZE IS THE IP MAXIMUM DATAGRAM SIZE MINUS FORTY&quot; (all capital
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; letters in  RFC879).  This implies that the host should advertise MSS=1460,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; but as  RFC 879 notes, when it was written there were &quot;no TCP header
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; options ... defined that would normally be sent at the same time as data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; segments.&quot;  RFC 1011 states &quot;The TCP Maximum Segment Size is the IP Maximum
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; Datagram Size minus forty,&quot; but sending TCP options with data segments was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; still an obscure subject when that was written.   Section 4.2.2.6, &quot;Maximum
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; Segment Size Option,&quot; of RFC1122, &quot;Host Requirements -- Communications
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; Layers,&quot;  does not explicitly say what value to advertise in the MSS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; option, but it gives a formula for Eff.snd.MSS, &quot;the maximum size of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; segment that TCP really sends,&quot; that is based on SendMSS, &quot;the MSS value
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*&gt; received from the remote host,&quot; and the TCPhdrsize.  If one solves that
<BR>
<P>Ed,
<BR>
<P>The MSS option is NOT intended as an MTU discovery mechanism.  It
<BR>
gives the max segment size the TCP receive and reassemble.  It does
<BR>
not, and is not intended to, tell the sender how large a segment to
<BR>
send.
<BR>
<P>It is strictly true, but perhaps irrelevant, that RFC 1122 does not
<BR>
specify what value to send in an MSS option.  However, it DOES
<BR>
give an upper bound on the value (MMS_R - 40) and a recommendation:
<BR>
determine MMS_R as specified in sections 3.3.3 and 3.4 (I see it
<BR>
should have referenced 3.3.2 also.)  When you dig down through
<BR>
all that, you find that MMS_R = EMTU_R - 20, where EMTU_R is
<BR>
the largest datagram IP can receive and reassemble... in other
<BR>
words, 65532.
<BR>
<P>So the recommended answer is:  65532 - 20 - 20 bytes should be
<BR>
sent in an MSS option.
<BR>
<P>So, back in the early days (early 1980s) the Berkeley Unix folks were
<BR>
trying to make TCP work well, and they (re-)discovered that IP
<BR>
fragmentation was a Bad Idea.  Rather than fix the protocol (by
<BR>
inventing MTU Path Discovery), they put in a hack: set the MSS down to
<BR>
the local interface MTU and hope.  This worked OK for awhile but was
<BR>
not really the right answer.  The (perhaps painful) discussion in RFC
<BR>
1122 was an attempt by a bunch of IETFers to set this business
<BR>
straight.
<BR>
<P>Note that the value you should send in the MSS option has no relation
<BR>
to the appearance of TCP options.  That is the problem of the sender
<BR>
only.  What the sender has to do is complex.  When I implemented
<BR>
the 1323 extensions and also T/TCP, I had to do considerable
<BR>
hacking on the BSD TCP machinery to get right the logic that
<BR>
determines a segment size to send. (I thought this was written
<BR>
up somewhere, but I cannot find it in any of the relevant RFCs
<BR>
now; maybe it was a comment in the T/TCP code).
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps,
<BR>
