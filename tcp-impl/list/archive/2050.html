<P><EM>&gt; Ok, so doing NFSv2/v3 header/data splitting is easy on an in-order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP stream because NFS has fixed-length trailers. Here's a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technique:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Note, to do this with NFS/TCP, your NIC has to do some primitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level of TCP processing (at least keep track of flows). It also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs to understand RPC/TCP message boundaries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do I understand correctly that you're applying the familiar
<BR>
NFS/UDP page flipping tactic to NFS/TCP?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are there significantly simpler approaches than this? 
</EM><BR>
<P>1. How about using NFS/UDP instead of NFS/TCP?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's well known in the NFS community that NFSv2-3/TCP is no faster or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise better than NFSv2-3/UDP except over very narrow or at least
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rather long pipes.  (Recall also the congestion control and avoidance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanisms in some NFSv2-3/UDP implementations.)
<BR>
<P>2. Use NFS/TCP, but send every RPC/XDR transaction in a single TCP segment,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and use IP fragmentation to fit the MTU.  This tactic was used for 10+
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;years ago in the FDDI adapters of some super computers.  It does have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the problems of IP fragmentation, but those problems are rarely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;encountered where NFS is used.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; NFSv4 doesn't seem to have fixed length trailers and neither
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does CIFS in all cases. And it looks like it will be costly to parse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NFSv4 headers. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've not been paying attention to NFSv4.  A quick skim of the draft
<BR>
suggests that it will not displace NFSv2/3 in the environments where NFS
<BR>
is currently popular.  NFSv4 certainly has nothing to do with anything
<BR>
like SCSI over IP.  I'm also far from convinced that NFSv4 has got some
<BR>
of the extensions close enough to the underlying real filesystems to be
<BR>
popular.  Even if I'm wrong, it will be years before NFSv4 is widely used
<BR>
While I think there are ways to page flip NFSv4 without special hardware,
<BR>
I don't think they are worth talking about yet.  Even if I'm also wrong
<BR>
about that, it is years early to be modifying TCP/IP to support NFSv4.
<BR>
No one can see what NFSv4 will be like when it is popular enough to justify
<BR>
modifying TCP today, if NFSv4 ever is popular.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; RDMA still has the following features:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Per-packet (Works with arbitrary out-of-order reception of TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segments)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Fixed header that's generic across all protocols (NFSv4, v5, AFS,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DFS, CIFS, etc..) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - No page flipping necessary on solicited transfers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Message boundary bit (which is admittedly orthogonal to RDMA) allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out-of-order processing on TCP receive buffer. Decreases parsing latency,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; esp. in the face of packet drops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Knowing to which buffer an out-of-order TCP segment belongs is something
<BR>
that I don't see how to do without something like RDMA.  However,
<BR>
out-of-order TCP segments are both very rare and very bad for TCP
<BR>
performance, regardless of whether RDMA is present.  Out of order
<BR>
TCP segments must be even more rare in storage networks.
<BR>
<P>Talk about NFSv5 or even AFS/DFS does the opposite of make me think there
<BR>
might be something good in RDMA.  And as I've said, it's years too early
<BR>
to justifiy RDMA with NFSv4.
<BR>
<P>With existing techniques, if you don't want to page flip, you don't need
<BR>
to.  If you are able to provide enough distinct application buffer streams
<BR>
to the NIC for RDMA, then you could do the same for other techniques.
<BR>
<P>What's that about &quot;parsing latency&quot; and what does it have to do with 
<BR>
lost segments?  Are you proposing to deliver TCP data to applications
<BR>
out of order?  I trust not!
<BR>

]No, that situation doesn't require any hardware support.  However, a zero-copy 
<BR>
] receive path is not the only element of RDMA - RDMA was designed (I suppose 
<BR>
] from the discussion here) specifically to address header/payload issues for 
<BR>
] storage protocols.  Clearly one can do zero-copy receive with changes to the 
<BR>
] API and no hardware/firmware modifications.  But with no special hardware 
<BR>
] support, flipping the payload into some page with alignment constraints will 
<BR>
] require another copy.
<BR>
<P>What about the many systems that have been page flipping NFS in and out
<BR>
of buffer caches for more than 10 years, with no changes to APIs or special
<BR>
silicon?
<BR>
<P>]There is one exception to my last statement that I know of:  If you pre-adjust 
<BR>
]the hardware receive buffers to make the payload align on a page boundary, you 
<BR>
] can flip the page into the buffer cache for (hopefully) the common case.  
<BR>
] However, this requires the ability to tune these header offsets and will only 
<BR>
] work for one protocol at a time (mostly).
<BR>
<P>The page flipping systems I've worked on did not tune header offsets and
<BR>
worked on more than one protocol.  (Given your email address, it might be
<BR>
interesting to check the old IRIX source trees.  Besides the NFS kernel
<BR>
code and the HIPPI, ATM, and FDDI drivers and firmware, check cmd/rcp and
<BR>
cmd/rsh.)  UDP page flipping is trivial on protocols that have no trailers.
<BR>
It requires trivial smarts in the NIC and much simpler buffer allocation
<BR>
by the NIC than RDMA requires.  (I suspect RDMA needs pools of buffers
<BR>
for every stream, while the classic tactic needs only two pools, &quot;little&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;pages&quot;....well, for tiny improvements I've also done it with &quot;little&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;medium&quot; and &quot;pages&quot;.)
<BR>
<P>] Realistically, who is going to be running a storage system that requires so 
<BR>
] much bandwidth that avoiding receive copies is necessary, and runs on generic 
<BR>
] NICs with no firmware/ASIC modifications possible?  So I think using modified 
<BR>
] hardware is completely reasonable in those circumstances.
<BR>
] ...
<BR>
<P>Even more reasonable than special hardware are modified API's and protocols
<BR>
and other steps, including ensuring that out-of-order packets are very
<BR>
rare, and with header offsets are few, fixed, known, and friendly.
<BR>
<P>How would you have out-of-order arrival on a storage network, other than
<BR>
due to bit rot in the wires, and what storage network is going to have
<BR>
significant bit rot?
