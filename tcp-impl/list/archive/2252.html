</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1122 completely (it only applying to use of APIs that close in both

<P>[ Hi folks.  I just joined the list --- am not a TCP implementor,
<BR>
but got interested in this particular issue for reasons about to be
<BR>
stated. ]
<BR>
<P>The situation that I am interested in is an application where data can
<BR>
flow asynchronously in both directions.  Actually, it's mostly a client
<BR>
request/server response protocol, but the server can also send
<BR>
unsolicited messages at any time.  In particular the server application
<BR>
can send an error message and immediately close the connection (indeed,
<BR>
it quits completely) without waiting around for the far-end app to get
<BR>
that message.  Question for the list is, is this application misusing
<BR>
the TCP protocol, and if so why?  Seems to me that once the TCP stack
<BR>
has accepted data to be sent, it ought to make a reasonable effort to
<BR>
deliver that data, whether the sending app is holding the connection
<BR>
open or not.
<BR>
<P>The problem case arises when the far-end app is busy sending a new
<BR>
request just as the near-end app emits its final message and closes
<BR>
its socket FD.  RFC 1122 (4.2.2.13) says
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A host MAY implement a &quot;half-duplex&quot; TCP close sequence, so
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that an application that has called CLOSE cannot continue to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read data from the connection.  If such a host issues a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOSE call while received data is still pending in TCP, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if new data is received after CLOSE is called, its TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD send a RST to show that data was lost.
<BR>
<P>(See also 2.16 and 2.17 in RFC 2525.)
<BR>
<P>Some, but not all, stacks appear to issue such an RST when they see
<BR>
incoming data from the far end, *even though they still have un-acked
<BR>
outbound data to transmit*.  This results in loss of the outbound data.
<BR>
A variant is that even if the data has been transmitted and acked but
<BR>
not actually delivered to the far-end client app, the far-end TCP may
<BR>
discard the data from its buffer upon receiving the RST.  Still a third
<BR>
variant (which seems to be what the current Linux stack does, at least
<BR>
when both ends are on the same machine) is that the far-end client may
<BR>
receive an ECONNRESET error from its next read() attempt, though not
<BR>
all the data has been delivered to it.  If the client is loony enough
<BR>
to think that ECONNRESET is a soft error, it will indeed discover that
<BR>
it can read more data by trying again!
<BR>
<P>I claim that all these behaviors are broken, and that the right thing
<BR>
to do if the TCP has noplace to deliver incoming data to is to ack and
<BR>
discard the data.  It would be OK to send an RST to discourage the other
<BR>
end from sending more data *only* if there is no un-ACKed data remaining
<BR>
to be sent from this end.  Without this, half-duplex connections are
<BR>
useless.  TCPs should also be dissuaded from dropping buffered inbound
<BR>
data when they see inbound RST or delivering a report of incoming RST
<BR>
out-of-sequence from the data.
<BR>
<P>The discussion at the Doubletree mostly focused on whether the app
<BR>
should deal with this situation by holding open its socket for some
<BR>
timeout period after sending its final outgoing message, so as to
<BR>
read and discard any data that might happen to arrive.  That is
<BR>
certainly the only available answer if one needs an answer today,
<BR>
but I still think that it's a workaround for broken TCP behavior.
<BR>
Essentially, this is asking the app to take on the connection-shutdown
<BR>
duties that TCP ought to handle for it.  (To take just one example,
<BR>
how should the app know what an appropriate timeout is?  Seems like
<BR>
that's a concern the TCP layer should deal with, not the app.  The app
<BR>
will also be unable to detect when the last outbound data has been
<BR>
ACKed, and will therefore have to hold the connection open much longer
<BR>
than would otherwise be necessary in most cases.)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, that's my story.  Is my app broken, or is the recommendation
<BR>
for issuing an RST in this scenario misguided?
<BR>
