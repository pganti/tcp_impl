<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A better estimate would take into account the 'permission to send'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would consider that a better fix to the bug, rather than 'research'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; per se.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I followed the thread right, the &quot;permission to send&quot; idea you outlined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; includes potential per-ack window fiddling, for acks that advance by more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a (so far unspecified) threshold.  This sounds like a potentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complicated fix that will need research to flesh it out.  Is that right,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or are you referring above to a different fix?
</EM><BR>
<P>The check of 'when did ack clocking fail' is based on some
<BR>
trigger - either due to per-packet processing
<BR>
(just before send, during receive/ACK processing, etc), or
<BR>
due to a timer.
<BR>
<P>The check that is done at that trigger can be based on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle time since last send
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle time since last receive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current window state
<BR>
<P>It seems that all solutions are points in that overall design space.
<BR>
In that case, there may be room to pick an 'appropriate' point,
<BR>
rather than a point which is an artifact (idle recv &gt; RTO, currently).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that the fundamental problem is recovering the ack clock whenever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's lost, which can occur due to reasons other than running idle.  But I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reluctant to try to address the general problem in the 2001 update, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think doing so will be significantly harder than just firming up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slow-start-on-idle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Recovering vs. detecting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Can we postpone this new function as 'research to be determined later'??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (when IW &gt; 1 has been accepted?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Part of the 2001 update is to put in hooks for IW &gt; 1 (we will initially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use IW=2, and edit the doc as needed down the line).  So it's appropriate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to adopt Craig's correction above.
</EM><BR>
<P>That being the case, I don't feel that detecting isn't 
<BR>
any more or less research than IW &gt; 1.
