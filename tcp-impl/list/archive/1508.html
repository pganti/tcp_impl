</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] Yes. Your definition of MSG_PUSH seems to exactly match the PUSH bit in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] the TCP spec (FINALLY!!!!!!!).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I tried to say earlier, it's almost 20 years too late for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considerations.  The PUSH bit irrevocably means what it now means,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as useless as that might be.  Or in other words, you can't starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tommorrow saying that a write without the MSG_PUSH option will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrarily delayed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there is a mis-understanding here.  Setting MSG_PUSH means
<BR>
push this data through (and set the PUSH flag when it gets to TCP).
<BR>
Lack of the MSG_PUSH does not mean that the data is not sent, nor
<BR>
that the PUSH flag will not be set.  At least that's my thinking.
<BR>
But this may just be support for your agument to call it something
<BR>
else than MSG_PUSH.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; First, the combination of modifying Nagle and adding MSG_PUSH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is what I would recommend, not just MSG_PUSH.  The combination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the two would eliminate most of the need for TCP_NODELAY.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe so, but I've doubts.   My current application would still need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP_NODELAY or would set MSG_NDELAY on every write, which I think amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same thing on the wire.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I've tossed around the idea of MSG_PUSH off and on for many years,
<BR>
and the fact that I haven't done anything about it sort of says that I
<BR>
haven't even convinced myself that it is really needed.
<BR>
<P>I do think the change to Nagle is good (supported by the fact that
<BR>
I implemented it in BSD/OS over 2 years ago).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that the MSG_NDELAY bit would be a nice supplement for writev(),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when where it is hard to get all of the buffers together for a writev().
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would also be a better way than TCP_NODELAY to patch code from the many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people that don't realize why write-write is a bad idea.   TCP_NODELAY is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a big hammer unless you really know there are no write-write sequences in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which the first write should be delayed.
</EM><BR>
<P>The question is are there enough real-world situations where this
<BR>
would be worth-while.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The point is that rather than bypassing Nagle in all instances,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; using MSG_PUSH you can bypass Nagle at the specific points where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you need to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I really like the Nagle algorithm, but how many applications really need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it today?  Among carefully written applications (i.e. use writev or at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least never more than 1 write/request) that might use MSG_NDELAY, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many would not get exactly the same results by TCP_NODELAY?
</EM><BR>
<P>A other question is, if you have the modification to Nagle, how
<BR>
many of those carefully written applications that use TCP_NODELAY
<BR>
could drop use of it?  Or would they still need TCP_NODELAY/MSG_NDELAY
<BR>
because they send multiple requests without waiting for a response
<BR>
to the first request?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The biggest trouble with MSG_NDELAY is the same as with writev().
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You'd have it where you don't really needed it (e.g. BSD systems)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not where you do need it (e.g. winsock).
</EM><BR>
<P>Patient: Doctor, it hurts when I do this.
<BR>
Doctor: Then don't do that.
<BR>
