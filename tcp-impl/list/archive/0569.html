<P>
||&gt; I'm not sure if your list implies window scaling, SACK and fast recovery
<BR>
||&gt; but it seems to me that they should get added to the MUST list as we go
<BR>
||&gt; forward.  I know its not research at this point but...
<BR>
||
<BR>
||I wasn't thinking of bringing these up, because as you note they're not
<BR>
||research.  Since they're implemented as TCP options (well, except for
<BR>
||fast recovery), it seems a little funny to make them MUST's - I also
<BR>
||don't see why they have to be MUST's in order for things to go forward.
<BR>
||The key is that implementations that care about high performance implement
<BR>
||them, and for that still works even if they're options.
<BR>
<P>fair enough; I'll desist on this one.
<BR>
<P>L.
