<P>
Rick,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The second biggie there - the small last segment is at least in part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solved by applying nagle on a per-send basis. That does indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leave-out the case where an application with 4097 bytes of data sends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it as 4096 +1, and that last &quot;1&quot; gets delayed because it was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; separate send. I'm still not sure that is not an application bug for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not presenting the 4097 bytes of data in a writev() or the like. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's say a web server (httpd) is reading data from a CGI script, buffering 
<BR>
it, and passing it down to TCP to send out over an ethernet.  Buffering it in 
<BR>
4096 byte chunks seems reasonable.  Let's say the CGI script writes 4096 bytes 
<BR>
(or, 5000 bytes, or ...).  Then the question is &quot;should the trailing bytes be 
<BR>
delayed by Nagle?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;.  The application, in this case, is doing an 
<BR>
adequate job of buffering (larger than the MSS), and the trailing data should 
<BR>
be sent &quot;immediately&quot; (modulo windows stuff).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; People are already wholesale disabling Nagle, the only question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether or not we can reverse that trend.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think making this change is a necessary, though perhaps not sufficient, step 
<BR>
in reversing that trend.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If the updated RFC is written as if it applies to the the output of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP, there will be someone who really wants to pick nits with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementations that are still doing the right/sufficient thing, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not implementing it precisely the same way. That of concerns me. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this is a valid point (as you have pointed out multiple times, and as 
<BR>
many other people have pointed out again and again).  I will try to re-write 
<BR>
the draft in a way that allows either behavior.  (I think i will say that some 
<BR>
implementations apply Nagle on application send(), and that that is perfectly 
<BR>
reasonable; i don't think i will say &quot;that is preferred&quot;, since that seems to 
<BR>
open a can of worms.  Thoughts from the assembled multitude?)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The bigger the sends become, the more Nagle+delACK becomes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; race condition or less of a concern yes?
</EM><BR>
<P>My experience is that the more you close the window for a race condition, the 
<BR>
more it seems to occur!
<BR>
<P><P>I think that by modifying the Nagle algorithm in the manner presented in the 
<BR>
draft, we can improve the performance for a percentage of the request/response 
<BR>
interactions for many internet applications (including the biggie, http) in a 
<BR>
way that is transparent to application developers.  I think this is a win.
<BR>
<P><P>Greg (who'd like to move a revised draft into the RFC process, possibly as 
<BR>
experimental)
