<EM>&gt; &gt; Now that is an interesting statement - does not the ACK of the SYN or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SYN|ACK imply that a packet has left the network, and isn't the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; idea conservation of packets?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the whole idea is convervation of *data* packets.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if I was going to be picky, I'd say that SYN segments consume
<BR>
sequence number space just like a data segment and call it metadata or
<BR>
something. 
<BR>
<P>Instead though I'll ask why the successful passage of a SYN segment
<BR>
should be any less informative than a data segment. If the intermediate
<BR>
queues are full or near full when a connection is established, the SYN
<BR>
(or SYN|ACK) would fill the last slot in the queue just like any data
<BR>
segment and would presumably preclude the addition of another segment
<BR>
(data, SYN, or ACK) just like a data segment. 
<BR>
<P>Further, doesn't a SYN segment's arrival trigger a RED drop of a data
<BR>
segment just like any other segment - or do the routers look to see what
<BR>
type of TCP segment it is?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; How about allowing the ACK to increase the window for the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; packets ACKed? Yes, it does mean that slow start isn't quite as slow ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An interesting research question - but out of scope for tcp-impl, as this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a significant change.
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't that the behaviour described in the original paper? 
<BR>
<P>Now if you really want to get into a researchy topic - how about
<BR>
congenstion avoidance applied to the sending of ACKs? They can be upward
<BR>
of 50% of the packets yes?
