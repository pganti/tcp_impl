<P>
<EM>&gt; This presumes that all bugs MUST be fixed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not &quot;MUST&quot; in the RFC sense - I view this document as turning into a BCP,
<BR>
not a standard.  Many of the problems already are MUSTs in the standard
<BR>
sense because of existing RFCs.  But some of these are less serious than
<BR>
others.  The idea here is to convey a sense of urgency and to aid in
<BR>
prioritizing efforts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	MUST fix this to be correct
</EM><BR>
<P>My thinking is instead: &quot;Critical that you fix this: you are hammering the
<BR>
Internet with avoidable congestion; or you are breaking TCP reliability; or
<BR>
you often won't interoperate; or you are open to a massive security hole,
<BR>
or ...&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	MAY fix this to help everyone out and help yourself in the process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		but we really can't say definitively that it's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		only way to solve the problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>This document is primarily about identifying problems, with some discussion
<BR>
of how to solve problems when there's collective wisdom/experience from
<BR>
the WG.  So I don't see the above, with an emphasis on solving the problem,
<BR>
as fitting with that notion.  It would though be a natural caveat to go with
<BR>
the section in the description discussing how to fix the problem.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, I don't see us documenting problems that for which we don't find
<BR>
rough consensus that the behavior is indeed a problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't know how to effect this, but would prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some &quot;strength&quot; categories, to tell implementers when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they hit the knee in the curve...
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, that's what I'm striving for with critical/serious/non-critical ...
<BR>
