<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; Im not arguing that der Mouse is doing the right thing in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances.  But we can't make every random faulty piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; equipment an item to assess when evaluating the need for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; keepalives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; It isn't a &quot;faulty piece of equipment&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well with RFC compliant keepalives his sessions get killed right ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes - He said so
</EM><BR>
<P>Then I misspoke.  Sessions get killed in two circumstances: when they
<BR>
don't have keepalives on, or when they do but the keepalives are
<BR>
insufficiently frequent.  If the application turns keepalives on, and
<BR>
I-the-admin crank the idle time down far enough (both of which are
<BR>
fully compliant as far as I know), sessions survive just fine.
<BR>
<P>My setup is noncompliant in only one respect: keepalives are forced on
<BR>
regardless of whether the application requests them.  I did this purely
<BR>
as a practical matter to avoid having to add a switch to every network
<BR>
program I use to make it turn on keepalives on command.  This is not
<BR>
really part of what I wished to discuss, since it's clearly
<BR>
noncompliant, I *know* it's noncompliant, and I'm not recommending it
<BR>
except to people also stuck in such situations.  (See RFC-1122 4.2.3.6
<BR>
for more.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Therefore the firewall is buggy against the RFC's it should have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configured with respect to.
</EM><BR>
<P>Stateful firewalls perforce are, aren't they?  If a connection breaks
<BR>
just because an intermediate box crashes and reboots, doesn't that
<BR>
violate some RFC?  (If it doesn't, it ought to! :-)
<BR>
<P>It's also pretty much independent of whether keepalives should be
<BR>
available.  One thing I have gotten quite clearly out of this thread is
<BR>
that the community is divided on whether keepalives are good....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All Im pointing out is that said misimplemented firewall is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relevant to the discussion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you wish to retreat from reality into the ivory tower.  One of
<BR>
the things TCP stacks have to do is be useful in the real world.  I
<BR>
would much rather not have to deal with that damn firewall, but I do,
<BR>
so I'm very glad that the TCP implementation I'm using gives me the
<BR>
tools with which to do so.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps it *isn't* relevant, actually; it's not clear to me what the
<BR>
discussion is discussing....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now I'll buy a lot of Vern's arguments for shorter keepalives due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resource issues and the fact a protocol keepalive is no less resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd say that settable-per-connection values would be good; httpd could
<BR>
set five minutes, sshd could set two hours, whatever.  Wouldn't even be
<BR>
very difficult to do, at least in the NetBSD code - I may do it when I
<BR>
get back from next week's vacation.
<BR>
<P>If it's too hard, or too resource-consumptive, to keep per-connection
<BR>
time values, it would, it seems to me, be reasonable to do something
<BR>
like have an initial idle time of five minutes, and if the peer
<BR>
responds to that keepalive, goose the idle time up to two hours or so
<BR>
for all future keepalives - the idea being that basically all
<BR>
connections are either very transient (for which even five minutes is
<BR>
perhaps a bit long) or reasonably long-lived (the sort of thing for
<BR>
which the two-hour default was designed).
<BR>
<P>But the values still need to be tuneable; there's still that trading
<BR>
house that wants keepalives on its LAN with idle=30sec intvl=1sec
<BR>
count=5.... :-)
