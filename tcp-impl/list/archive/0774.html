<EM>&gt; &gt; The important point, that is not explict in RFC 1122, is that the URG flag

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; segment with data that would not otherwise be sendable (which may or may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; include the data at the urgent pointer) is a way to accomplish this, but I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not sure that it is a good idea to provide this back-door mechanism to bypass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all send controls.  I believe that the right thing to do when the sender TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is presented with outbound urgent data at a time when the send rules preclude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; putting a segment on the wire is to generate a zero-length segment with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; URG flag on and the urgent pointer set.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is the value of the URG flag without the URG data being present?
</EM><BR>
<P>TCP does not have urgent data in the sense that seems to be being discussed
<BR>
here (at least my understanding of what is being said).  TCP has an urgent
<BR>
pointer and an URG flag.  In TCP the Urgent Data is all the data up to
<BR>
the Urgent pointer, and when a TCP sees the URG flag, it goes into urgent
<BR>
mode while processing the data up to the Urgent pointer.  This means that
<BR>
if an application has pending, unsent data and it sends more data in urgent
<BR>
mode, all the previous, unsent data becomes urgent data.  In fact, if
<BR>
the receiving TCP has accepted data that it hasn't yet presented to the
<BR>
user and it gets an URG, all that unread data becomes &quot;urgent data&quot; to
<BR>
the application.
<BR>
<P>Also remember that the urgent pointer is allowed to point beyond the
<BR>
packet that contains it, and even beyond the TCP window.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there any concern about the legacy TCP's processing such a segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correctly?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From other mail on this list, I seems so.  But the only hard reason
</EM><BR>
that a TCP can't send new data is if the window is closed.  And if it
<BR>
is closed, you can still send one byte of data as a window probe.
<BR>
So there is no need to send out a zero-length packet just to get out
<BR>
the urgent notification.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, how is the proposed behaviour any greater a back door than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP_NODELAY, which is a huge, gaping door already?
</EM><BR>
<P>Setting TCP_NODELAY doesn't short-circuit any of the congestion control
<BR>
code.  In the BSD stack, on an idle connection the first write will
<BR>
always go out, no matter how small.  It is successive small writes that
<BR>
get delayed until an ACK is received or a full segments worth of data is
<BR>
accumulated.  Setting TCP_NODELAY says that if another small write is
<BR>
done while there is un-acked data, don't wait for the ack to come back
<BR>
before sending the data.
<BR>
<P>Sending data in urgent mode is the same as turning on TCP_NODELAY
<BR>
just before doing the write and turning it back off after the write.
<BR>
One additional thing about sending data in urgent mode is that in
<BR>
the BSD stack if the window is closed, it will force a one-byte
<BR>
window probe to be sent (which will have the urgent flag/pointer).
