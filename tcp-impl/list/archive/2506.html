wow!  that was a nice discussion. I got cleared up with many of my doubts.
<BR>
But  whatever discussion which went about this is abou the Congestion window
<BR>
(cwnd). But my basic doubt is the selection of  the send window ( snd.wnd) or
<BR>
in other terms it is the peer's receive window which is advertised to the
<BR>
sender . Selecting this receive window might be implementation dependent , but
<BR>
I like to know what will be criteria and what all parameters affect this
<BR>
selection. I hope atleast this time Iam clear ..
<BR>
<P>Thanks

<EM>&gt; &gt; The stack has to determine the initial window size, and all it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has is the address of the other host, and MSS derived from MTU.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the contrary, &quot;the stack&quot; is just code.  BSD-style code could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow the if pointers to find the interface speed as easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it now finds the interface MTU to generate the MSS option.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Practically speaking, most stacks use a hard-wired default (32k
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or 8k or whatever). They could a better job taking MSS into account.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; To your other point, MTU definitely  has to do with the speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and memory on the adaptor. That's why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you will see higher MTUs with higher speeds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is true that as the years have passed, media have become faster
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as MTU's generally have grown longer.  However, Ethernet is a rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important counter example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As far as 6-8 times the MTU being from mid 80s is not correct either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In fact, BSD 4.3 Reno had 2k windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for local communications, which is even less than that ratio.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 6-8 figure is based on my own experiments and measurements done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the early 90s.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So in about 1986 I did not change the default TCP window shipped by one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the major commercial UNIX vendors to 30K?  And in about 1988 I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change it to 60K?  That's interesting, because I didn't think I'd become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so senile that I'd invent such recollections.  (Note that I don't mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I changed it from the default that someone at the factory set.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean that according to those false recollections of mine, I was that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone at the factory.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, as a reasult of my enthusiasm for better`ttcp` numbers to give to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; employer's sales people (and my own bosses), I also saw some bug reports
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of interoperability problems.  Some were related to bugs in other vendors'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems uncovered by large mismatches in window sizes.
</EM><BR>
