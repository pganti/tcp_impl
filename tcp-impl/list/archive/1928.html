Sure, you've seen this make money surfing the web stuff, right?  Things like 
<BR>
alladvantage.com and things like that....well....they're really getting hard 
<BR>
to run, because everybody who is, has already signed up for them, you know?
<BR>
<P>Well, have I got the thing for you.  This this is primarily like 
<BR>
alladvantage.com, HOWEVER you can make a little more on it, and NOBODY has it 
<BR>
yet.  So now it's time for you to be a kingpin this time, and be at the top 
<BR>
of the chain.
<BR>
<P>If you're going to do this, the key is sending to your friends, and to people 
<BR>
who are moativated with this, and SYKE them up, and you're bound to do at 
<BR>
least decent with this.
<BR>
<P>There are a lot of things you can do, and make a little money once...what I 
<BR>
like about this is, you refer people once, and then you just keep making 
<BR>
money from it....for good.  You really can't go wrong......
<BR>
<P>So, please, check it out, and if you like it, sign up.  Referring people 
<BR>
shouldn't be that bad, because basically nobody has this yet.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your time :-)
