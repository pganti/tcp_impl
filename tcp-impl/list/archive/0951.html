<EM>&gt;&gt;         In this trace, the application process is terminated on Machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         D at approximately 13:48:36.34 and it sends the FIN with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         window opened again (since it properly discarded the previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         received data). Machine C promptly sends more data, causing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         Machine D to reset the connection since it can not deliver the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         data to the application.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is it stated someplace that a window update should not be taken as an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;indication that the data has been received into the application? If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;feels&quot; as though there is an implicit assumption that if the window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advances, data has been presented to the application - for instance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from 1122, section 4.2.2.14
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;When the application program subsequently consumes the data and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increases the available receive buffer space again...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Not sure why you introduce this. There is no assumption about an ACK
<BR>
meaning data has been received by an application. My point regarding
<BR>
this problem is that if the application has CLOSED the socket in such a
<BR>
way that it indicates &quot;I am no longer interested in reading further data
<BR>
from the socket&quot; (such as if the application crashes or, in UNIX, does a
<BR>
close on the socket), the TCP stack MUST assure that it takes steps to
<BR>
either reset the connection or discard any previously received data and
<BR>
opens the window to allow the connection to properly close (since if the
<BR>
window is closed, the peer can't deliver any more data and send the FIN
<BR>
to close its end of the connection - hanging the connection).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Would it be better to reset upon a window probe?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe so. I believe it best to either open the window (and
<BR>
reset the connection if more data is received) or just reset the
<BR>
connection immediately.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Or is this an area where we say that an applicaiton needs its own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;app-level protocol for what was and was not received?
</EM><BR>
<P>I would say that applications that needs this might. A lot of apps may
<BR>
not if they use typical command/reply sequences or other mechanisms.
