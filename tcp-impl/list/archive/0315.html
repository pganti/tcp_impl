<EM>&gt; The reality of HTTP is that it is an interactive bulk transport
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocol; i.e. there are users, who often changes their minds as a result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of what they see on the screen, and then surf on to another page
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or further down the screen, with a different set of embedded graphics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fetch).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Control of latency by a browser is therefore important.  This isn't just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file transfer...
</EM><BR>
<P>This is something that should be fixed within HTTP using a single TCP
<BR>
flow.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Major HTTP/1.1 goals include: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improving performance for end users 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lower HTTP's load on the Internet for the same amount of &quot;real work&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make HTTP a good &quot;network citizen&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enable applications to work reliably even with caching 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/1.1 includes a number of new elements that together should have a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;major effect on Internet traffic. These include:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport improvements, consisting of persistent connections,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additions to allow pipelining,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transport data compression, and range requests. All of these
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improvements are optional parts of HTTP/1.1. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caching extensions, to allow applications to work reliably in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the face of caching, and to allow applications to mark more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;content cacheable, including the results of searches.
<BR>
<P>That is from:

<BR>
<P>which you no doubt know about since your name is on it.
<BR>
<P>The client can make limited range requests, overlapped to keep data in
<BR>
flight (for example: request two large ranges and when the first is
<BR>
complete request a third).  When you have to switch streams because a
<BR>
different inline is in view, request ranges from that one.
<BR>
<P>I don't think HTTP supports it yet but the ability to say &quot;clear my
<BR>
list of requests that you haven't already started sending and send
<BR>
this instead&quot;.  It might also be useful to be able to make one request
<BR>
to send in chunks and then use this &quot;cancel and reshuffle&quot; request if
<BR>
the sending order needs to change.
<BR>
<P>Any WAN transport is going to have to keep data in flight to keep
<BR>
performance up and to do so is going to have to live with a delay in
<BR>
switching from one stream to another including living with some data
<BR>
in the wire and in the router queue in front of the stream you just
<BR>
switched to.  The only optimization you can do is to try to reduce the
<BR>
amount of data in flight so as not to be excessive and slow the
<BR>
switch.  Reducing data in flight too much would reduce performance in
<BR>
the normal streaming case.
<BR>
<P>One way to reduce the cutover time is to provide an indication in the
<BR>
initial HTTP request of the clients recieve buffer size.  The server
<BR>
can set the send buffer size to match (accomodating faster links as
<BR>
well as slower links and allowing the default to be set small) before
<BR>
ever writing to the socket.  This way the amount of data in the send
<BR>
buffer on the server host prior to switch over is at most 1 send
<BR>
buffer worth (which should be only a few RTT if the client hasn't set
<BR>
the receive buffer way too big.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now if you'd like the Web to go off and invent its own transport protocol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than TCP, I'm sure there are people in the Web community who'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happy to do so.  Just don't count on them understanding congestion and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flow control issues very well. :-(.  And maybe this is the right thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do ultimately.  But there be dragons there, as this mailing list certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knows.

<P>I don't follow the HTTP WG but I thought the more clueful among them
<BR>
are trying to consolidate the HTTP multiple flow mess into one TCP
<BR>
flow as the HTTP 1.1 changes do.
<BR>
<P>Curtis
<BR>
<P>ps- This is no longer about TCP implementation so if we want to talk
<BR>
further about possible ways to tune HTTP can we take this offline.
