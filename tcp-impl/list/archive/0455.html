<P>
||I can't resist commenting that T/TCP (Transaction TCP) would have
<BR>
||avoided this problem.
<BR>
||
<BR>
<P>yes it would have.  If anyone ever implemented it.  We looked at it
<BR>
2-3 years back; thought it was a good idea; than asked the question
<BR>
&quot;so who would we do TTCP with?&quot;.  That finished that.
<BR>
<P>||I think it is generally agreed that the original Web browsers were
<BR>
||abusing TCP, trying to use it as a transaction transport protocol by
<BR>
||creating many short connections.  My Webby friends tell me that this
<BR>
||has now been fixed, and proper Web browsers using the latest HTTP
<BR>
||should use many fewer TCP connections.  There is an incentive to upgrade,
<BR>
||since the resulting user performance is signfificantly better.  So
<BR>
||perhaps it is time to fix broken TCPs that short-cut TIME-WAIT state.
<BR>
||
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From what I see on the wire the two leading commercial PC browsers
</EM><BR>
use HTTP V 1.0, not V 1.1 which would *supposedly* solve the problem.
<BR>
I say supposedly because until HTTP V 1.1 is commericially deployed and
<BR>
tested I'm not sure I'm ready to buy into its &quot;solves the worlds problems&quot;
<BR>
promise.
<BR>
<P>It looks good in theory, but theory...
