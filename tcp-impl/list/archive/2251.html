<P>
Attendees:  Ian Heavens (&quot;chair&quot;/minutes,Spider Software), William Gilliam (HP),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Touch (ISI), Bernie Volz (IPworks), Tom Lane (sss?), Scott Lawrence (Agranat)
<BR>
<P>I hope these notes reflect the discussion - please add/correct if not!
<BR>
It was (as always at the IETF) a spirited discussion and I may have
<BR>
not always reflected the consensus accurately. 
<BR>
<P>1.  Error codes with RSTs
<BR>
<P>Two approaches to this were apparent - useful diagnostic tool (just need to 
<BR>
see these on the wire) - and whether the receiver could do anything useful
<BR>
with them.  As pointed out on the mailing list, the RST data field is
<BR>
not appropriate for the latter  - no API, and standardising this might (or will)
<BR>
overlap with other current uses.  Joe Touch pointed out that what is
<BR>
really needed is a generic &quot;Instrumentation Option&quot; that can be carried
<BR>
in any segment.  However, the &quot;send RST error code&quot; option would have
<BR>
to default to on (send it unless the receiver NAKs the option request),
<BR>
or the current usefulness of using the data field would be lost (until
<BR>
receiver TCP implementations supported the option).  Instrumentation option
<BR>
could be passed to the application as SACK option implementation supports this.
<BR>
[the SACK people would like this option too - Matt Matthis told me afterwards
<BR>
however that currently SACK options must be sent with the SYN as some implementations
<BR>
fall over if the first TCP option is sent with a non-SYN segment.  So this
<BR>
must be solved before the instrumentation option is generally useful.
<BR>
<P>Two conclusions: [1] Instrumentation option generally useful and the only mechanism
<BR>
by which RST error codes can be standardised [2] RST error code taxonomy
<BR>
can still be published as an Informational RFC as it will be needed for
<BR>
use by the instrumentation option (and TCP implementations that send data
<BR>
with RSTs in this way can - at least - use agreed codes) [is anyone arguing
<BR>
that it is bad to use RST data in this manner?  Or just that it cannot be
<BR>
reserved for this usage?]. 
<BR>
<P>I don't know if anyone wants to follow up the instrumentation option issue??
<BR>
HP/Mentat/Spider/(Sun?) will complete and submit my RST error codes draft. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
2. TIME-WAIT and RSTs
<BR>
<P>There is no TIME-WAIT after RST (first submitted in expired draft by myself
<BR>
in 1994 I think..) and so no protection against acceptance of stale data
<BR>
by a new connection.  Solutions discussed in that draft and Joe Touch's paper
<BR>
on using RSTs to transfer responsibility for TIME-WAIT from servers to clients.
<BR>
Basically TIME-WAIT after sending a RST (in ESTABLISHED and half-closed states)
<BR>
with 'soft and hard TIME-WAIT' indicating how RSTs are treated in TIME-WAIT
<BR>
(stemming from RFC 1337 and Joe's paper).
<BR>
<P>We discussed the implementation issues in supporting many TIME-WAITS - as this
<BR>
was perceived at the time as an obstacle to solving the issue, since TIME-WAIT
<BR>
after RST will increase the number of connections in TIME-WAIT state: 
<BR>
these are well documented and understood now.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I will submit the &quot;Problem Statement&quot; again as an Informational RFC (to underline
<BR>
that application writers should not abort connections with a RST to circumvent
<BR>
TIME-WAIT: Scott Bradner suggested a few years ago that it could be a Best Current
<BR>
Practices to reinforce this).  Joe/myself/Ted Faber will submit the solution as an 
<BR>
internet draft (whether Informational or standards track will depend on whether
<BR>
it is perceived that the solution is preferable to the status quo).  This will
<BR>
strongly reference work on implementation issues.
<BR>
<P>3.  Miscellaneous application and API issues
<BR>
<P>Tom  Lane has highlighted a usage of RSTs that conflicts with RFC 1122 half duplex
<BR>
close recommendation (and emphasised in RFC 2525 - contributed by me).  Bernie Volz 
<BR>
and Tom discussed this after so I don't know whether the conclusion was that the 
<BR>
application should avoid sockets close() and use shutdown() - thereby circumventing 
<BR>
RFC 1122 completely (it only applying to use of APIs that close in both directions ).
<BR>
To be pursued on the list if appropriate, with possible clarification of RFC 1122
<BR>
and RFC 2525.
<BR>
<P>The Transport Area WG is appropriate for discussion of the above drafts and the
<BR>
authors will bring them to a future IETF meeting...
<BR>
<P>Thanks to all those who participated
<BR>
<P>ian (about to duck :-)
<BR>
<P>PS I will put together a web page with the missing references above
