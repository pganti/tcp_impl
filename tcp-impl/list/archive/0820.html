<P>
K. K. Ramakrishnan and I have submitted an Internet draft on &quot;A
<BR>
Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IPv6 and to
<BR>
TCP&quot; today.  A copy of the draft is attached.
<BR>
<P>We would welcome comments.  While the proposal involves the domain
<BR>
of several working groups (ipng, tcpimp, etc.), and we are therefore sending
<BR>
this announcement to the mailing lists of several working groups,
<BR>
we are assuming that general discussion will happen on the
<BR>
end2end-interest mailing list.  (Subscription information for
<BR>
end2end-interest: &quot;<A HREF="http://www.irtf.org/irtf/charters/end2end.htm">http://www.irtf.org/irtf/charters/end2end.htm</A>&quot;.)
<BR>
<P>The first step is for ipng to decide whether or not to add the
<BR>
appropriate bits to the IPv6 header.  But if that happens, then I
<BR>
believe that the second step is discussion of the required changes to
<BR>
TCP in tcpimp.
<BR>
<P>Thanks very much,
<BR>
Sally Floyd and K. K. Ramakrishnan.

<P>Abstract
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This note describes a proposed addition of ECN (Explicit Congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification) to IPv6 and to TCP.  First we describe TCP's use of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet drops as an indication of congestion.  Next we argue that with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the addition of active queue management (e.g., RED) to the Internet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infrastructure, where routers detect congestion before the queue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overflows, routers are no longer limited to packet drops as an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indication of congestion, but could instead set an ECN bit in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet header, for ECN-capable transport protocols.  We describe when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ECN bit would be set in the routers, and describe what
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modifications would be needed to TCP to make it ECN-capable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications to other transport protocols (e.g., unreliable unicast
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or multicast, reliable multicast, other reliable unicast transport
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocols) could be considered as those protocols advance through the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standards process.

<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP's congestion control and avoidance algorithms are based on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notion that the network is a black-box [Jacobson88, Jacobson90].  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;network's state of congestion or otherwise is determined by end-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems probing for the network state, by gradually increasing the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;load on the network (by increasing the window of packets that are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outstanding in the network) until the network becomes congested and a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet is lost.  Treating the network as a &quot;black-box&quot; and treating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss as an indication of congestion in the network is appropriate for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pure best-effort data carried by TCP that has little or no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensitivity to delay or loss of individual packets.  In addition,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP's congestion management algorithms have techniques built-in (such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as fast retransmit and fast recovery) to minimize the impact of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;losses from a throughput perspective.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these mechanisms are not intended to help applications that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are in fact sensitive to the delay or loss of one or more individual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets.  Interactive traffic such as telnet, web-browsing, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer of audio and video data (&quot;real-audio&quot; and &quot;real-video&quot;) can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be sensitive to packet losses (for unreliable data delivery such as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UDP) or to the increased latency of the packet caused by the need to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmit the packet after a loss (for reliable data delivery such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as TCP).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since TCP determines the appropriate congestion window to use by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gradually increasing the window size until it experiences a dropped
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet, this causes the queues at the bottleneck router to build up.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With most packet drop policies at the router that are not sensitive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the load placed by each individual flow, this means that some of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the packets of latency-sensitive flows are going to be dropped.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active queue management mechanisms that detect congestion before the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue overflows, and provide an indication of this congestion to TCP,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is desirable because it avoids some bad properties of dropping on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue overflow, especially with drop-tail schemes.  Drop tail
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;introduces synchronization of loss across multiple flows which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undesirable.  Indicating incipient congestion means that TCP does not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to increase its window size up to the point where a router's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer is filled up. This can reduce queuing delays and avoid
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synchronization, which are desirable characteristics.
<BR>
<P>2. Random Early Detection (RED)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random Early Detection (RED) is a mechanism for active queue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;management that has been proposed to detect incipient congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[FJ93], and is currently being deployed in the Internet backbone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RED-ietf-draft].  Although RED is meant to be a general mechanism
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using one of several alternatives for congestion indication, in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current environment of the Internet RED is restricted to using packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drops as a mechanism for congestion indication.  By dropping packets

<BR>
<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the average queue length exceeding a threshold, rather than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only when the queue overflows, RED maintains the average queue at a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smaller level, and improves the delay experienced by the flows.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when RED drops packets before the queue actually overflows,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RED is not forced by memory limitations to discard the packet.  RED
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could set an Explicit Congestion Notification bit in the packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;header instead of dropping the packet, if such a bit was provided in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the IP header and understood by the transport protocol.  The use of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Explicit Congestion Notification bit would allow the receiver(s)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive the packet, avoiding the potential for excessive delays
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to retransmissions after packet losses.
<BR>
<P>3. Explicit Congestion Notification
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose that the Internet provide a congestion indication for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incipient congestion (as in RED and earlier work [RJ90]) where the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notification can sometimes be through marking packets rather than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropping them.  This would require an ECN field in the IP header with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two bits.  The ECN-Capable bit would be set by the data sender to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicate an ECN-capable transport protocol.  The ECN bit would be set
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the router to indicate congestion to the end nodes. ([Floyd94]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outlines a scheme where a single bit could be overloaded to serve the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function of both the ECN-Capable bit and the ECN bit, but the two-bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scheme is more straightforward to explain). We expect that routers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would provide the congestion indication on incipient congestion as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated by the average queue size, using the RED algorithms
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested in [FJ93, RED-ietf-draft].  Routers that have a packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arriving at a full queue would drop the packet, just as they do now.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The congestion control algorithms followed at the end-systems would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be essentially the same as the congestion control response to a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*single* dropped packet, for a transport protocol where a dropped
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet is used as an indication of congestion.  For TCP in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular, the source TCP would halve its congestion window &quot;cwnd&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in response to an ECN indication received by the data receiver.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this action is done only once per window of data (i.e., at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most once per roundtrip time), to avoid reacting multiple times to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple indications of congestion within a roundtrip time.
<BR>
<P>4. Proposed Algorithm at the Router
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe the proposed algorithm at the router in the context of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current router implementations.  We assume that the router is capable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of implementing the probability computation for RED and uses a pure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet drop mechanism (e.g., drop from front, drop from tail, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;random drop) whenever a packet arrives at a full queue.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the router's buffer is not yet full and the router is prepared
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to drop a packet to inform end nodes of incipient congestion, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;router should first check to see if the ECN-Capable bit is set in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that packet's IP header.  If so, then instead of dropping the packet,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the router could instead set the ECN bit in the IP header.  When more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severe congestion has occurred and the router's queue is full, then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the router has no choice but to drop some packet when a new packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrives.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The router determines it is congested if the AVERAGE length of any of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its queues where packets are waiting to be processed or transmitted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceeds a threshold. We believe that the router should use the ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit to notify that it is congested only when the *average* queue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;length, rather than the instantaneous queue length, exceeds a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshold.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are potentially several alternatives for estimating the average
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue length and marking the ECN bit. Since there is considerable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effort involved already in implementing RED, we believe it is best to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leverage these efforts for ECN as well.  One potential mechanism for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the averaging and marking is to perform functions similar to RED
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue management: RED uses an exponential moving average of the queue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size.  When the average queue size goes above a lower threshold,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets are marked with a probability of marking that increases with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the average queue size.  (Packets that are not ECN-capable are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropped instead of marked.) When the average queue size gets up to or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above a high threshold, all incoming packets should be dropped
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(assuming that the router intends to control the average queue size
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even in the presence of unresponsive traffic).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated that when all of the source end-systems participate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in TCP's congestion management mechanisms or other compatible
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion control, and respond to ECN by reducing their offered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;load, packet losses would be relatively infrequent.  Packet losses in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this case would occur primarily during transients and in the presence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of non-cooperating entities.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a packet is received by a router with the ECN bit set indicating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that congestion was encountered upstream, then the bit is left
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unchanged, and the packet transmitted as usual.
<BR>
<P>5. Support from the Transport Protocol
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN requires support from the transport protocol, in addition to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN field in the IPv6 packet header.  For TCP, ECN requires two new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanisms:  negotiation between the endpoints during setup to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine if they are both ECN-capable, and an ECN-Notify bit in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP header so that the data receiver can inform the data sender when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a packet has been received with the ECN bit set.  The support

<BR>
<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required from other transport protocols is likely to be different,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular for unreliable or reliable multicast transport protocols,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will have to be determined as other transport protocols are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought to the IETF for standardization.  The following sections
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;describe in detail the proposed TCP use of ECN.  This is also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described in [Floyd94].  We assume that the source TCP uses the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current set of congestion control algorithms of Slow-start, Fast
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retransmit and Fast Recovery [RFC 2001].
<BR>
<P>5.1. TCP Initialization
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, the source and destination TCPs exchange the desire and/or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capability to use ECN in the TCP connection setup phase.  As a result
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the negotiation, the TCP sender indicates using the ECN-Capable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit in the IPv6 header that the transport is capable and willing to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participate in ECN.  This will indicate to the routers that they may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mark packets with the ECN bit, if they would like to use that as a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method of congestion notification. If the TCP connection does not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wish to use ECN notification, the sending TCP sets the ECN-Capable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit equal to 0 (i.e., not set), and the TCP receiver ignores the ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit in received packets.
<BR>
<P>5.2. The TCP Sender
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a connection that expects to use ECN, packets are transmitted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the ECN-Capable bit set in the IP header (set to a &quot;1&quot;).  If the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sender receives a TCP acknowledgement with the ECN-Notify bit set in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the TCP header, then the sender knows that congestion was encountered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the network on the path from the sender to the receiver.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indication of congestion should be treated just as a congestion loss
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in non-ECN-Capable TCP. That is, the TCP source halves the congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window &quot;cwnd&quot; and reduces the slow start threshold &quot;ssthresh&quot;.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending TCP does NOT increase the congestion window in response to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the receipt of an ACK packet with the ECN-Notify bit set.  However, a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very important difference is that TCP does not react to ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion indications more than once every window of data (or more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loosely, more than once every round-trip time). If a response to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN-Notify bit was made over the last round-trip time, based on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window of packets, then the sending TCP doesn't respond to any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further ECN messages. If at time &quot;t&quot;, the source TCP reacted to an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN, then it notes the packets that are outstanding at that time and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not yet been acknowledged. Until all these packets are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledged, say at time &quot;u&quot;, the source TCP does not react to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another ECN indication of congestion.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, when a TCP sender receives duplicate acks during the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time interval between &quot;t&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, it does not reduce the congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.  The result is that decreases in the congestion window occur

<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at most once per roundtrip time.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the TCP sender receives a packet with the ECN-Notify bit set,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore reduces its congestion window, the sender does not need
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to slow-start (as is done in Tahoe TCP in response to a packet drop)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or to stop sending packets for a period of time to allow the queue to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dissipate (as is done by Reno TCP for roughly half a round-trip time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in response to a packet drop).  The ECN-Notify bit being set does not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicate the urgent transient congestion state of a buffer overflow.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incoming acknowledgements will still arrive to &quot;clock out&quot; outgoing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets when allowed by the congestion window.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP follows existing algorithms for sending data packets in response
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to incoming ACKs, multiple duplicate acknowledgements, or retransmit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeouts [RFC2001].
<BR>
<P>5.3. The TCP Receiver
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the destination end-system, when TCP receives a packet with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN bit set in the IP header, TCP sets the ECN-Notify bit in the TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;header in the returning ACK packet.  We do not provide here any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notion of destination congestion, because this is already being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated in the receiver's advertised window.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination TCP continues to perform the duplicate ACK procedure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already specified - to generate a duplicate ACK when an out-of-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sequence packet is received.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any ACK withholding implemented, as in current TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations where the TCP receiver often sends an ACK for two
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arriving data packets, then the TCP destination will send the OR of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the ECN bits of packets that the ACK is acknowledging. That is,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if any packet is received with the ECN bit set, then the ACK carries
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ECN-Notify bit set.
<BR>
<P>5.4. Congestion on the ACK-path
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the current generation of TCP congestion control algorithms, pure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledgement packets (e.g., packets that do not contain any
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accompanying data) should be sent with the ECN-capable bit off.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current TCP receivers have no mechanisms for reducing traffic on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACK-path in response to congestion notification.  Mechanisms for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responding to congestion on the ACK-path can be relegated as an area
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for future research.  (One simple possibility would be for the sender
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reduce its congestion window when it receives a pure ACK packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the ECN bit set). For current TCP implementations, a single
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropped ACK generally has only a very small effect on the TCP's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending rate.

<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>6. Summary of changes required in IPv6 and TCP
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bits need to be specified in the IPv6 header, the ECN-Capable bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the ECN bit.  The ECN-Capable bit set to &quot;0&quot; indicates that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transport protocol will ignore the ECN bit.  This is the default
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value.  The ECN-Capable bit set to &quot;1&quot; indicates that the transport
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol is willing and able to participate in ECN.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default value for the ECN bit is &quot;0&quot;.  The router sets the ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit to &quot;1&quot; to indicate congestion to the end nodes.  The ECN bit in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet header should never be reset by a router from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;0&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP requires two changes, a negotiation phase during setup to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine if both end nodes are ECN-capable, and a bit in the TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;header (possibly one of the &quot;reserved&quot; bits in the TCP flags field)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an ECN-Notify bit so that the receiver can inform the sender of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet received with the ECN bit set.
<BR>
<P>7. Non-relationship to ATM's EFCI indicator or Frame Relay's FECN
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these ATM and Frame Relay mechanisms typically have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defined without any notion of average queue size as the basis for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concluding that there is congestion, we believe that they provide a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very noisy signal. The interpretation we have here for ECN is NOT the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate reaction for such a noisy signal of congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notification. It is our belief that such mechanisms would be phased
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out over time within the ATM network.  However, if the routers that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interface to the ATM network have a way of maintaining the average
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue at the interface, and use it to come to a conclusion that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATM subnet is congested or otherwise, they may use the ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notification that is defined here.
<BR>
<P>8. Non-compliance by the End Nodes
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that, for the most part, the fairness properties of TCP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not be changed with the introduction of ECN.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key issue concerns the vulnerability of ECN to non-compliant end-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nodes (i.e., end nodes that set the ECN-capable bit in packets, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not respond to the ECN bit itself).  These concerns exist even in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-ECN environments.  An end-node could &quot;turn off congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control&quot; by not reducing its congestion window in response to packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drops.  We recognize that this is a concern for the current Internet.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued that routers will have to deploy mechanisms to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detect and differentially treat packets from non-compliant flows.  It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is likely that techniques such as end-to-end per-flow scheduling and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isolation of one flow from another, potentially accompanied by end-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to-end reservations, could mitigate such effects. Such isolation
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanisms could remove some of the more egregious effects of non-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compliance.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even in networks just restricted to packet losses as an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indication of congestion, several methods have been proposed to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify and treat non-compliant or unresponsive flows.  These
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanisms would be equally applicable for identifying flows that do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not respond to ECN.  If anything, routers would have a slightly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easier time identifying flows that do not respond to ECN.  For
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, routers can observe packets arriving at the router with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN bit set, as well as keeping note of packets that have the ECN bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set at that router itself.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued that dropping packets in itself may be considered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a deterrrent for non-compliance.  However, we believe that the packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drop rates are likely to be reasonably low in environments where ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is deployed.  The reduction in load due to packet drops to deal with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-compliant nodes is likely to be small.  The control of congestion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is more likely to come from end-nodes reacting to congestion - either
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from responding to dropped packets or ECN Notify indications and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;halving the window.  ECN should be used at a router when the average
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue size is below some high threshold; when the average queue size
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceeds the high threshold, and therefore packet drop/marking rates
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are higher, our recommendation is that routers drop packets, rather
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then setting the ECN bit in packet headers.  Thus, in scenarios with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low packet drop rates, the fact that the congestion control
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indications are in the form of packet drops rather than ECN bits does
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not significantly change the negative consequences on the compliant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flows because of some flow &quot;turning off&quot; congestion control.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not believe that packet dropping itself is an effective
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deterrent for non-compliance.  Many flows that retransmit dropped
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets could have an incentive to maintain or even increase their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending rate in response to packet drops, rather than decreasing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their sending rate, in the absence of mechanisms at the router to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide a negative deterrance for such behavior.  For example, flows
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that use unreliable transport protocols could simply increase their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of FEC in response to an increased packet drop rate, and might
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose increased FEC and no congestion control.  We believe that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect of packet dropping as a deterrence for non-compliance with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion control mechanisms is quite small.  The possibility of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-compliant flows does not offer a compelling reason not to deploy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECN.
<BR>
<P>9. Additional Considerations
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some care is required to handle the ECN and ECN-Capable bits
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriately when packets are encapsulated and un-encapsulated for
<BR>
<P><P>Ramakrishnan and Floyd       Informational                      [Page 8]
<BR>

<BR>
<P>draft-kksjf-ecn     Addition of ECN to IPv6 and TCP        November 1997
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tunnels.  When the router at the end of the tunnel decapsulates the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet, then the ECN bit in the encapsulating ('outside') header
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be ORed with the ECN bit in the encapsulated ('inside') header
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that remains.  Basically, a 1 in the encapsulating header should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copied into the encapsulated header.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional issue concerns packets that have the ECN bit set at one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;router, and are later dropped at another router.  For the proposed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use for ECN in this paper (that is, for data packets for TCP), this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a concern, because end nodes detect dropped data packets, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the congestion response of the end nodes to a dropped data packet is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least as strong as the congestion response to a packet received
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the ECN bit set.  This issue will have to be addressed if ECN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ECN-Capable bits are used on pure ACK packets, because in current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations of TCP the drop of an ACK packet is not explicitly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detected by the end nodes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a packet with the ECN bit is later dropped due to corruption (bit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errors), the end node should still invoke congestion control, just as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP would today, to a dropped data packet.  This issue would also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to be addressed in future proposals for distinguishing between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets dropped due to corruption and packets dropped due to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion.
<BR>
<P>10. Conclusions
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current effort to implement RED, we believe this is the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right time for router vendors to examine how to also implement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congestion avoidance mechanisms that do not depend on packet drops
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alone.  With the growth of applications and transports that are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensitive to delay and loss of a single packet, depending on packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss as a normal congestion notification mechanism appears to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insufficient (or at the very least, non-optimal).
