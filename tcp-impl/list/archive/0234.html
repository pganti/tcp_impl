</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh?  If you are saying that we don't do slow-start when connected to a machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the same subnet, that is not true.  We do slow-start on every connection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have evidence to the contrary, let's see it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Very well, in the next message.  It will take a bit of time to compose,
<BR>
as the traces are sitting on my laptop.  I just happened to make them a
<BR>
couple of weeks ago, when trying to figure out why the throughput was so
<BR>
bad after I upgraded to MacOS 7.6.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I understand the discussion on this point, and consider it fair game for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recommendations by this group, but I need to understand why you are using it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as criticism while this is not a requirement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Because it causes link congestion, and massive retransmission.  In your
<BR>
stack, as in others.
<BR>
<P>I'm getting pretty tired of the plaint &quot;this is not a requirement.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Once upon a time, requirements were the &quot;minimal set&quot;.  You seem to
<BR>
interpret them as the &quot;complete set&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Do the right thing&quot; is the only real requirement!  Do we have to spell
<BR>
out every niggling detail?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I also see no Nagle algorithm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is an almost slanderous misrepresentation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
A misrepresentation of what &quot;I see&quot;?
<BR>
<P>You can get my postal address from any IETF Proceedings, or whois was4,
<BR>
and I look forward to receiving your lawyers' communication.
<BR>
<P>How wonderful -- we were worried that this list would be populated by PR
<BR>
management flacks instead of technical folks; and sure enough, we have
<BR>
Mentat.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I also see Ack-only packets immediately followed by data packets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More of the same.  ACKs should be deferred only so long, and may occur just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before new data is sent.  If you have something to show me that looks like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a systematic problem, please send it along and I will be happy to look at it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I'll send the list a short excerpt.  I'd send you personally the entire
<BR>
2.5 megabyte run, but I'm not at all certain I'd like a potential
<BR>
litigator to read even one day of my email.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; OT 1.1.1 did include some serious RTT problems, which I take full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibility for, that were very noticeable on slow links.  These have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resolved for some time, but did not make it into OT 1.1.2.  Apple has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promising to get these fixes out, but you will have to talk to them about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when you will see them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
The first time I've seen 10 Mbps ethernet characterized as a slow link.
<BR>
<P>Maybe when I have time, I'll run a slow (28.8 Kbps) PPP trace to compare.
<BR>
<P>Apple has cancelled further OT development.  And shipments of OT 1.1.1
<BR>
are running to the millions of units.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, I will note that these &quot;requirements&quot; are long standing, and
<BR>
OT was &quot;tested&quot; for several years.  And doesn't a major workstation
<BR>
vendor ship a Mentat stack, too?
