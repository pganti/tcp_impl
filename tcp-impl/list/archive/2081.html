<P>
If the peer to which a TCP connection has been established is on a &quot;direct connected&quot; network (i.e. the route doesn't point to a gateway), why exactly is slow start required? Linux and NetBSD seem to do slow start for this case while FreeBSD doesn't seem to (I haven't picked through the source to verify this though). Since slow start is meant to &quot;probe the available network bandwidth&quot; of a route (involving routers), it seems to me that I really shouldn't have to use slow start for the case mentioned above. 
<BR>
<P>One of the e-mails in this list mentioned a case where the outbound interface queue was overwhelmed by a burst of packets when slow start was not used. Slow start seems to be a wrong way to solve this problem. This problem could happen even when too many connections are opened, and hence is a fundamental inter-layer flow control problem.
<BR>
<P>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
