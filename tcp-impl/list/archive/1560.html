<EM>&gt;If httpd had not seen REQ 2, then you are right, the 0.25 RES 2 will be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delayed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is a timing issue, you are right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Notice, however, that if you were using something like SO_EXPLICITPUSH, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you set SO_EXPLICITPUSH for the 1.25 RES 1, and then turned around and set 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SO_EXPLICITPUSH for the 0.25 RES 2, *my* [fictional] implementation would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*also* delay the 0.25 RES 2.  (This is because i would be using 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SO_EXPLICITPUSH as a way to *avoid* sending &lt; MSS packets, but would *still* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be protecting the network from excess traffic from small packets.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, I think a simple write-through mechanism would be easier to deal with.
<BR>
Isn't the point exactly that the app knows it is a small packet but it
<BR>
wants it to go out anyway because it is &quot;the Right Thing&quot; in that
<BR>
particular situation?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Having an adaptive delayed ack scheme is an interesting idea (that others, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;including John Nagle recently, have thought about).  I don't know if it
</EM><BR>
would 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;be based on link speed, &quot;one-way-ness&quot; of application traffic, or what.
</EM><BR>
It is 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;independent of the Nagle modification.
</EM><BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(**) Any idea how much HTTP is pipelined these days, or what the trend is?
</EM><BR>
<P>In HTTP itself, there are only a few clients that do pipelining - roughly
<BR>
speaking applications based on my libwww code
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/">http://www.w3.org/Library/</A>
<BR>
<P>The major argument against it on client side is that it is (too) hard to
<BR>
implement (one reason being that HTTP/1.1 has 5 different ways of
<BR>
delimiting messages). As it is significantly simpler on server side, this
<BR>
is much more commonly supported.
<BR>
<P>However, if work on WebMUX is truly starting in the IETF, a lot of the
<BR>
complexity will go away as WebMux has a much better handle on the message
<BR>
length. In that case, pipelining is likely to become much more common than
<BR>
it is now.
