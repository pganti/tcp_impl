</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So you are saying that the sender has to set the PSH bit just before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; receiver closes the window all the way, even if it has unsent data queued
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and ready to go?  The &quot;definite implementation bug&quot; is on the receiver side.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I meant the opposite: if the sender doesn't have any more data to send,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it needs to set PSH.  The receiver's window doesn't enter into it, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just the question of whether the sender at the moment could not possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send any more data.
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly agree that if the sender has no more data to send, then it must
<BR>
set the PSH bit.  If it isn't doing that then the sender is more broken than
<BR>
the receiver.  I saw the term &quot;deadlock&quot; in the problem description, which
<BR>
I thought implied that neither side could proceed.  If the sender has more
<BR>
data to send, but is looking at a closed (or silly) window, then it can not
<BR>
proceed, and is under no obligation to show a PSH bit.
<BR>
<P>What concerns me is that some of this discussion has seemed to imply that a
<BR>
trace showing a sender which almost never turns on the PSH bit somehow implies
<BR>
that there is something wrong with the sender implementation.  This is clearly
<BR>
not true.  If the sender is faster than the receiver, meaning that the sender
<BR>
always has unsent data ready to go, then there is no obligation to turn on the
<BR>
PSH bit until the FIN goes out.  If there really is a receiver that will
<BR>
refuse to send any data upstream until it sees a PSH bit, and will in fact
<BR>
let its receive window shrink to zero as a result, then I hope we can all agree
<BR>
that this is a receiver problem, not a sender problem.
<BR>
<P>As for the question of what the receiver should do that is better, well almost
<BR>
anything, right?  Send data upstream immediately...  Count bytes and send data
<BR>
upstream when a threshold is reached...  Send everything upstream if a timer
<BR>
goes off...  Don't hold more than half the window...  All of the above!
