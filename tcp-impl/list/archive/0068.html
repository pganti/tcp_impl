<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It doesn't make sense to have the client send out a reset, and yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; still be in FIN_WAIT_2 state. If it sends a reset, the server is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; supposed to delete its end and stop sending anything else. What will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; take the client out of the FIN_WAIT_2 state (normally, it is a FIN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from the server!)?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We're talking about two different things here.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK. I think I'm getting somewhat misled by terminology and
<BR>
nomenclature.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem occurs when the client send a FIN to abort a connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ie, user hits 'stop'.  In this case we go to FIN_WAIT_2 ( as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the other prior states ).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think it's quite correct to say &quot;abort a connection&quot; and at
<BR>
the same time send a FIN and go through the normal closing
<BR>
procedure. If you are going through the normal connection closing
<BR>
steps, the application (I would assume) remains &quot;attached&quot; to the
<BR>
socket, and the problematic scenario shouldn't arise. Right?
<BR>
<P>I've been assuming that &quot;abort a connection&quot; means sending a RST,
<BR>
i.e., the case where the application &quot;destroys&quot; the socket.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I really don't see this as a big issue. I'd venture that in the vast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; majority of cases, at the exect time the client half-duplex closes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; connection, there will be no received data queued by TCP (at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; receiver), so this scenario won't happen frequently in practice. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is absolutely critical, however, is that any subsequent TCP packets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that arrive for that connection cause a RST to be generated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, its a trememdously big issue, and it happens more often than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many peopl think, in terms of the web.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think my point didn't come through clearly (though Rich is correct
<BR>
to point out the my assumption is somewhat flawed). I think the issue
<BR>
of whether or not to send a RST if the connection is half-duplex
<BR>
closed AND there is queued data in the receive queue is not the main
<BR>
issue, with respect to keeping servers from hanging. If the server has
<BR>
unacknowledged data (including possibly a FIN), it will retransmit, at
<BR>
which point the reset will be generated.  So the server shouldn't hang
<BR>
forever, which is what started this long thread.
<BR>
<P>I agree that sending a RST may reduce the total number of packets
<BR>
that ultimately get sent, which is of course a good thing.
