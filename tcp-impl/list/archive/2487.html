<EM>&gt; Rick and der Mouse,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have some doubts regarding your interpretation of the problem. I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under the impression that a blocking write (or send) call would block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until it has received an ACK or an RST for data sent and then perform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 2nd write.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am afraid your impression, while perhaps natual to the untainted :),
<BR>
is incorrect. As often as not, a send/write call to a socket will
<BR>
complete once the data has been copied into the stack. This is well
<BR>
before it is ACKnowledged by the remote, or even sent out the wire.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have noticed that this  happens even when I had made two write calls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by breaking  the request (1+32)  while making the first normal request
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the server. (check the previous linuxdump.txt file). I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appended relevant parts of it here:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 17:31:17.186250 eth0 &gt; wsasa3005.asa-ehv.ce.philips.com.1181 &gt; asaehv.ce.philips.com.www: P 1:2(1) ack 1 win 32120 (DF)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 17:31:17.233839 eth0 &lt; asaehv.ce.philips.com.www &gt; wsasa3005.asa-ehv.ce.philips.com.1181: . 1:1(0) ack 2 win 8760 (DF)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 17:31:17.233891 eth0 &gt; wsasa3005.asa-ehv.ce.philips.com.1181 &gt; asaehv.ce.philips.com.www: P 2:34(32) ack 1 win 32120 (DF)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As you can see, when I make my first write call by sending 1 byte of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data, it  waits until it receives the ACK and then proceed with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second write. That means, in this case write call blocks until the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server or peer TCP ackowledges the data. (unless using non-blocking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sockets, or using MSG_DONTWAIT option if used with send() call). Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in this case, I have not disabled Nagle's algoritm. Ofcourse, my linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; client is a dual P-II terminal.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you are seeing in that trace is the Nagle algorithm, implying
<BR>
nothing about the completion semantics of the write() call against a
<BR>
socket. I suspect that if you were to run a system call trace on your
<BR>
program at the same time, you would find that the second write() call
<BR>
happened before the ACK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After, looking into all this, is it possible that RST can be received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even after the application has already come out from the first write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call ?? ...or its actually the tcp stack that's still not able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detect the RST just before sending the request data for the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; write (as you can see it still detects if some delay is given). Maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something to do with silly window syndrome since I am writing small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of data... ??
</EM><BR>
<P>Even on a &quot;blocking socket&quot; a send/write completes once the data is
<BR>
written into the socket buffer. This is independent of the decisions TCP
<BR>
makes about when to send data onto the wire. 
<BR>
<P>If the socket buffer is full, the write() call will block, but only
<BR>
until enough space is freed via ACK's or _prior_ writes to allow the
<BR>
data of this write() into the buffer.
<BR>
<P>I guess the fancier way to say it is that writing data into the
<BR>
connection is asynchronous from that data being send on the wire.
<BR>
<P>All splitting writes will do is cause your app lication to run afoul of
<BR>
the nagle algorithm and take more CPU cycles on the system than it
<BR>
should.
<BR>
<P>If you want to detect remote connection close (via FIN) use the
<BR>
zero-bytes on a recv/read semantic. If you want to detect remote
<BR>
connection death, implement a keepalive handshake in your app.
