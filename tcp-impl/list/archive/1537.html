<P>
Rick,
<BR>
<P>I see what you are saying:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But if that application is presenting that data in separate send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls, and it was indeed data that was really one unit, is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application broken or not? The whole issue here is for request/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response applications right? Which means that there is all the data of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;request&quot; and then all the data of the &quot;response.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it is reasonable to have the application buffer reasonable amounts of 
<BR>
data, but i'm not sure it is reasonable to say it must buffer 50Kbytes or 
<BR>
100Kbytes.  It seems to me (but, i agree, there is room here to differ) that 
<BR>
if the application is passing down its response (or request) in 4096 byte 
<BR>
chunks (to pick a popular size), TCP should &quot;work well&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Greg
