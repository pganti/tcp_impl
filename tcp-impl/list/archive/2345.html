<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you looked at the Yarrow paper I gave a link to?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's good advise.  It says that Yarrow-160 uses 3-DES instead of Blowfish
<BR>
as you said, or even Twofish as one might expect given the key scheduling
<BR>
costs of Blowfish, the application (crypto-PRNG's), and the common source
<BR>
of Blowfish, Twofish, and Yarrow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess the short summary should be that cryptographers know how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make good PRNGs, and they even give them away into public domain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the other hands, non-cryptographers--predictably--have less thorough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding of producing cryptographically secure PRNGs.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the short summary is something about people who have read a little
<BR>
about things outside their strict expertise, and then want to talk about
<BR>
them in yet other contexts where they not well versed.  (I admit to knowing
<BR>
no more about crypto stuff than the very little I've read and a few
<BR>
commercial implementations of some bog standard encryption stuff.)
<BR>
<P>As Bruce Schneier of Blowfish, Yarrow, and Twofish fame has been saying
<BR>
a lot lately, designing and implementing a wonderful cipher is the
<BR>
relatively easy part of the battle.  You should look at the whole picture,
<BR>
from what you're trying to protect to how much you should spend protecting
<BR>
it.  The old analogies of armoured car deliveries to park benches and
<BR>
super-duper vault doors on cardboard boxes are relevant.
<BR>
<P>This particular context concerns TCP initial sequence numbers.
<BR>
Cryptographic PRNG's, /dev/random, entropy pools, DES, PGP, SHA and so
<BR>
forth are merely tools for the main issue, bad guys guessing ISN's.
<BR>
<P>The ISN issue once mattered, but today it is a minor threat blown out of
<BR>
proportion by &quot;security audit&quot; software vendors, &quot;computer security&quot;
<BR>
consultants, trade rag consultant authors, and others.  What bad things
<BR>
happen if you use completely predictable ISN's?  You've fixed your systems
<BR>
to not use IP addresses as authenticators by turning off /etc/hosts.equiv
<BR>
and .rhosts, right?  So what if a bad guy predicts all of your ISN's?
