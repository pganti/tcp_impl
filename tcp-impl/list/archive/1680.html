Hi,
<BR>
<P>I'm sure somebody's thought of this before, but I can't figure out why
<BR>
it wouldn't have worked.
<BR>
<P>Suppose that instead of doing this complex probe operation that we have
<BR>
today, we just send datagrams with fragmentation allowed. Then, if
<BR>
fragmentation does occur somewhere, the recipient responds with a TCP
<BR>
option that states &quot;fragmentation occurred: fragment size is X&quot;
<BR>
<P>This would let the sender immediately drop the MSS down to the reported
<BR>
size, and we wouldn't have any of this crap that we have to go through
<BR>
today for PMTU (ICMP probs, etc.).
<BR>
<P>The only issue I can see here is that the sender may transmit lots of
<BR>
too-big segments, and on a lossy network the resulting fragmentation
<BR>
could cause all data to get lost. However, slow start would seem to
<BR>
prevent this from happening. In that case, the same strategies used
<BR>
today would still work (scale down until successful).
<BR>
<P>The other issue would be coordinating between TCP and IP, so that IP
<BR>
could tell TCP when fragmentation had in fact occurred (based on the
<BR>
header bits). I suppose one alternative to this would be for IP to send
<BR>
this option/message if it gets data for TCP where fragmentation has
<BR>
occurred.
<BR>
<P>The upsides to using an option is that it gets to ride for free on the
<BR>
ACKs, it will get ignored if the original sender doesn't understand it,
<BR>
and it won't be blocked by firewalls.
<BR>
<P>Thoughts?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
