<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree that delivery to an application is unlikely.  I was making the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; point that after a RST, one is much more likely to get data than after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a FIN exchange.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still don't see why this is.  It takes half an RTT (roughly) for either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the RST or the first FIN to travel to the other peer.  At that point, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either case the peer should stop sending new data.  So I don't see why one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is much more likely to get data with a RST.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's only a problem if data arrives in CLOSED state.
<BR>
<P>For the RST case, while the RST is in transit, up to a window of
<BR>
data may arrive in CLOSED state, since it may have already left
<BR>
the peer before the RST arrives.
<BR>
<P>For the FIN case, a window of data may be in transit - but it will
<BR>
arrive in FIN_WAIT_1.  The other end can continue transmitting until
<BR>
it sends a FIN (this data will arrive in FIN_WAIT_2).  To arrive in
<BR>
TIME-WAIT, the data has to be reordered with the second FIN, or
<BR>
duplicated in the network, or have been lost and retransmitted.
<BR>
(if the peer sends a FIN before it receives our FIN, the data arrives in
<BR>
CLOSING or LAST-ACK state at one or both peers).  So even if TIME-WAIT
<BR>
state is omitted, the chance of data arriving in CLOSED state at one
<BR>
end or the other is small - roughly the probability of a segment being
<BR>
reordered, lost or duplicated.  
<BR>
<P>I might have got the above analysis not quite right, but I think
<BR>
that's roughly how it works.  After a RST, you often get a lot of
<BR>
segments in CLOSED state (e.g. the correct implementation of half
<BR>
duplex close in the Known Bugs I-D).  After a FIN, a single segment
<BR>
is unlikely to arrive in TIME-WAIT (or CLOSED state if TIME-WAIT is
<BR>
omitted).
<BR>
<P>Then the chance of actual data corruption is factored by the chance
<BR>
of a new application opening with the port/sequence number space
<BR>
overlapping that of one or more of the segments that arrived in
<BR>
CLOSED state, which makes it a low probability event for either case.
<BR>
<P>Awaiting corrections...
