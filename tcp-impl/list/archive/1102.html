<P>  Technical Co-Sponsored by IEEE Communication Society
  Technical Co-Sponsored by ITG (German Information Technologies Society)
  With support from the European's Commission ACTS Programme
<P>WORKSHOP OBJECTIVE: 
<P>This is the fifth in a series of international work-
shops - Tokyo in 1994, Bristol in 1995, Princeton in 
1996 and Seoul in 1997 - aimed at stimulating tech-
nical exchanges in the emerging and strategically 
important field of Mobile Multimedia Communica-
tions. MoMuC'98 is intended to provide a timely 
forum for exploratory research contributions, and to 
promote cross-disciplinary technical interactions in 
an informal setting. The scope of the workshop 
includes broadband wireless networking for data 
and multimedia, mobile multimedia system &amp; appli-
cations together with associated mobile computing 
terminals, video processing and software. 
<P>The workshop goal is to bring together researchers, 
practitioners and potential users of this emerging 
technology. The workshop targets at experts in mul-
timedia systems, mobility issues in network proto-
cols and communication systems. The impact of the 
workshop is to provide an effective forum for origi-
nal and fundamental advances in Mobile Multime-
dia Systems and to foster communication among 
researchers and practitioners working in a wide vari-
ety of scientific areas with a common interest in 
mobile multimedia communication. 
<P>After the MoMuC'98 Workshop, the First Workshop on Wireless 
Broadband Testbeds (<A HREF="http://comet.columbia.edu/demo98/">http://comet.columbia.edu/demo98/</A>), 
which is co-located with MoMuC'98, 
will be held on October 15, 1998.
<P>TECHNICAL PROGRAM:
<P>The 3-day technical program will primarily consist 
of contributed research papers. In addition, there 
will be a few distinguished invited speakers and 
expert panel sessions providing a broad perspective 
in each technical area. The conference language is 
english.
<P>TECHNICAL TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE 
(but are not limited to): 
<P>        WIRELESS NETWORKS FOR MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATION
- broadband wireless networks
- wireless ATM
- voice/data in CDMA &amp; TDMA systems 
- high-speed wireless modems &amp; radio techniques
- medium access/data link control and handoff protocols
- quality-of-service (QoS) management in wireless networks
- wireless network signaling, control &amp; mobility management
- mobile internet protocol 
- wireless network management &amp; services control
        MOBILE MULTIMEDIA TERMINAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
- multimedia terminal hardware
- signal processing techniques
- low power VLSI for mobile computing
- video compression, including MPEG-4
- network API and transport protocols
- software technologies for personal multimedia
        MOBILE MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS
- mobile computing 
- optimization of bandwidth use
- powers saving
- mobility support in ATM and INTERNET
- QoS and mobility
- adaptive applications
- system architectures for mobile multimedia 
- innovative prototypes, systems &amp; products 
- multimedia satellite systems 
- personal multimedia applications 
<P>We especially invite submissions pertaining to sys-
tem approach rather than investigation of individual 
mechanisms. If individual mechanisms are consid-
ered, their relevance to the multimedia communica-
tion system should be clearly stated. Papers on all 
aspects of multimedia mobile communication are 
welcome. Of particular interest are papers which 
address the system aspects: design, real-life experi-
ences, but relevant papers concerned with individual 
important mechanisms are also welcome. Authors 
are invited to submit extended abstracts, clearly stat-
ing the problem statement, the approach to its solu-
tion, the approach used as well as the main results. 
In case of system description the new features/
mechanisms should be exposed, in case of contribu-
tions concerned with individual mechanisms their 
relevance for multimedia mobile communication 
should be stressed. 
<P><P>SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
<P>Contributions in english are invited in the form of 
extended abstracts (about 1500 words) which should 
be submitted electronically before May 14, 1998.
<P>All submitted papers will be refereed for quality, 
correctness, originality and relevance. The program 
committee reserves the right to accept a submission 
as full paper or poster presentation. All accepted 
papers will be published in the conference proceed-
ings. Authors will be interested to know that issuing 
a book containing outstanding papers from the 
Workshop is being planned. 
<P>To submit a paper send an email to <A HREF="mailto:momuc98@ee.tu-berlin.de?Subject=Re:%20MoMuC'98:%202nd%20Call%20for%20Papers&In-Reply-To=&lt;35409626.6DE6@ft.ee.tu-berlin.de&gt;">momuc98@ee.tu-berlin.de</A> 
including:
<P>   - a cover sheet, which contains: 
     *   title, 
     *   author(s),
     *   author's affiliation, 
     *   email address(es), 
     *   fax number and 
     *   postal address.
     *   In case of multiple authors, the author's name 
         which is responsible for correspondence and
         preparing the camera ready paper for the proceedings.
   - the submitted paper (single spaced, 10 point Times font, 
     A4 paper, Postscript or PDF format) as attachment.  
     All printed material (text, illustrations) must be kept 
     within a print area of 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide 
     by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm) high. 
     On all pages, the bottom margin should be 
     approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the 
     bottom edge of the page (A4 paper). 
<P>If it is not possible to submit via email, send five copies of 
the manuscript to the following address, including a
cover sheet with the above mentioned informations. 
<P>Submission address for hardcopies:
<P>Prof. Dr.-Ing. Adam Wolisz

<P>VENUE: 
<P>MoMuC `98 will be held in Berlin, the city which 
after 40 years of splitting is now the live symbol of 
the German reunification, and on its way to the grow 
into the role of the German capital. It is currently 
one of the largest construction sites worldwide. On 
the other hand it is also a city of industry, the place 
where the first tram worldwide was operating, where glo-
bal companies like Siemens started off and still have 
a strong position. Nowadays Berlin is changing its 
economic role away from mainly industrial to 
become a service-oriented gateway to the new 
democracies in Eastern Europe. Located between 
numerous lakes it has more bridges than Venice, 
Italy within its city limits. It is a vibrant cultural 
metropolis, with 3 Opera Houses, several Musicals 
Houses and hundreds of theaters. It offers a very 
exiting and surprising nightlife scene with countless 
restaurants, bars, clubs and galleries.
