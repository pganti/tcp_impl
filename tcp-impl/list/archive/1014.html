<P>
One of the main topics for discussion at next week's tcpimpl meeting is
<BR>
increasing TCP's initial window to 3 or 4 segments.  (We already found
<BR>
rough consensus for an increase to 2 segments at last December's DC
<BR>
meeting.)  We'd really like to have some discussion of this change on the
<BR>
mailing list prior to the meeting.  To this end, Sally Floyd put together
<BR>
the appended note in order to summarize the issues and encourage discussion.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vern
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Here is the summary:
<BR>
<P>(1) At the last tcpimpl meeting, we had rough consensus for allowing
<BR>
a TCP Initial Window (IW) of two segments, and agreed to revisit
<BR>
at this meeting the question of initial windows of three or four
<BR>
segments.
<BR>
<P>(2) Mark Allman and I have revised the internet-draft
<BR>
draft-floyd-incr-init-win-01.txt, to reflect the current state of the
<BR>
discussion.   The revised draft adds the following specifications and/or
<BR>
clarifications:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The increased IW would only apply after the initial SYN/ACK handshake.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If the SYN or SYN-ack had to be retransmitted, then the side
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retransmitting it must start with IW=1.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A more lengthy discussion of interactions with the &quot;Don't Fragment&quot; (DF)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit, including a recommendation to recompute the IW if the segment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size is changed during Path MTU Discovery.
<BR>
<P>(3) The new I-D also covers some additional simulation and other results:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A description of the bursts of two and three segments common during
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow-start, and of the four-segment bursts common whan a single
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delayed-ACK is dropped.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Studies by [HAGT98] showing that the use of larger initial windows
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decreases HTTP transfer time, for experiments in a satellite environment.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Studies by [PN98] investigating the impact of larger initial windows
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on competing traffic in a simulation scenario with both HTTP and FTP flows.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger initial windows decreased HTTP transfer times and at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same time slightly increased the segment drop rate.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Studies by [Mor97] showing that in a heavily-congested network,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initial windows of four segments can **increase** HTTP transfer times
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and increase the segment drop rate.
<BR>
<P>My own assessment of the discussion to date is that there is a
<BR>
reasonably-solid consensus in favor of allowing an IW of three segments
<BR>
(for MSS &lt; 2190 bytes).  It is not clear to me if there is a consensus
<BR>
in favor of allowing an IW of four segments (for MSS &lt;= 1095 bytes).
<BR>
