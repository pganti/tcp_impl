<EM>&gt; The same large software company near Seattle does send RST when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the socket queue is full and it can't accept another connection (this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was especially bad in earlier releases of that company's TCP/IP software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when the backlog could only be set to a small number of connection). The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal (4.4BSD) practice is to simply ignore the SYN and allow the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal TCP retransmission of the SYN to &quot;try again&quot; a short time later.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since this large software company chose to RST instead, I think they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decided that they also needed to retry several times and hence that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what their &quot;connect&quot; implementation does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did, a long while ago, suggest to their developers that they change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this behavoir to be more in line with standard practices. But alas ...
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be the same company that decides they need to send a RST to
<BR>
terminate connections from their popular HTTP client.  The only answer I
<BR>
could ever get about why they do this is because this other company did it
<BR>
with their popular HTTP client, so it had to be a desirable way of doing
<BR>
things, regardless of how broken it may be (and it does cause real-world
<BR>
problems).  
<BR>
<P>I was under the odd impression that TCP did something where it magically
<BR>
resent the SYN if it didn't get a response.  I was also under the odd
<BR>
impression that by simply ignoring the SYN if the server was too busy (in
<BR>
whatever way you want to define busy) would result in all clients properly
<BR>
retrying the connection at some later time.  This idea seems to make sense
<BR>
to me because it uses TCP's established retransmission method and requires
<BR>
nothing of clients except that they comply with the spec while still
<BR>
offering the server a second chance if it is too busy at a particular
<BR>
moment.
<BR>
<P>If a server wishes to send a RST instead, I can't see that it is horrible.
<BR>
All it means is that the server is saying that the connection can not be
<BR>
made, period, and that it must have no expectation that the client would
<BR>
take it upon itself to retry the connection without user intervention.
<BR>
<P>Modifying your client to automatically retry the connection using its own
<BR>
(possibly very broken and harmful) retransmissions methods is, however, a
<BR>
different matter that I find difficult to justify.  The only possible
<BR>
justification I can think of is that, for whatever reason, the server is
<BR>
normally unable to handle the load being placed on it and is often having
<BR>
to do such things.  In that case, implementing your own retransmission
<BR>
timeouts in this method would result in the perception of better
<BR>
performance, however the real problem is that the server's TCP stack or
<BR>
application program is unable to handle the requests.
<BR>
<P>If I were cynical, I would suggest that the reason for my first complaint
<BR>
(RST terminating connections) is due to other limitations in some vendors
<BR>
(both Unix and NT) stacks WRT large numbers of sockets in TIME_WAIT.
<BR>
<P>I am always disappointed when vendors try to force their methods by sheer
<BR>
market force without discussion or consideration of technical merit, but
<BR>
thats the way things have always been.
