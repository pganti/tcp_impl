<P>
Please excuse my interjection.  As a long time EE and network
<BR>
consultant, I've been amazed at how long some of the myths you mention
<BR>
have lasted (e.g., 37% is Enet's load limit).  It's common practice, for
<BR>
instance, in well-designed Ethernets, to run at 70% 24 hrs/day with no
<BR>
issue -- one of the most famous Wall St. trading companies has done that
<BR>
for years.  Part of the reason why this is not commonly understood is
<BR>
that in the '70s IBM was not about to license anything from Xerox.  Now,
<BR>
of course, they can't build Enet interfaces fast enough.  
<BR>
The problems with ring systems were discussed well in ACM papers around
<BR>
November 95/96, and ATM's problems are just becoming evident to its
<BR>
guinea pigs.  As a consultant, of course, that means money for me, but
<BR>
there is some disappointment that marketing at IBM, Fore and elsewhere
<BR>
over the years has been able to waste others' time and money on
<BR>
inappropriate technology.  
<BR>
<P>For those who've been mislead by Miller's and other texts, by authors
<BR>
who misread either each other or the original IEEE 802 committee's
<BR>
simulation results, I've attached the DEC Western Research Lab report
<BR>
from '88 (Postscript), where it was clearly demonstrated by one of
<BR>
Enet's inventors that 90% throughput (not just load), with minor
<BR>
collision levels, is quite easy.  Sorry for the size, but it's an
<BR>
important document -- show your children.  The earlier IEEE simulations
<BR>
actually demostrated, to the observant, that Enet gets better than ring
<BR>
systems as the number of nodes increases (see attached Powerpoint
<BR>
version) -- CSMA/CD is always quicker at resolving contention than is
<BR>
token passing.  We probably should have it right by now, after 20 years
<BR>
experience with a technology.  I hope these comments are useful to
<BR>
someone.  
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; | I agree completely with Constantinos concerns regarding non-adaptive traffic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; At the risk of being screamed at for improperly Cc:-ing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; two lists, I don't suppose anyone on either has any evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to support the assertion in Constantinos's first point?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's the same evidence that has been around for decades.  More, it is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same issue that is a root of the TLD DNS nonsense infesting the main IETF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list.  Many people are unable to conceive of a working distributed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooperative system, whether in politics, business, or network packets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a result, they either demand a central commission to run it or rush to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exploit its imagined weaknesses.  Thus, you get the ancient IBM token ring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claims that CSMA/CD does not work (e.g. the 30% silliness), because mere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistics are in charge on an Ethernet.  Then came the FDDI claims that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CSMA/CD does not work, followed the 100VG-AnyLAN stories.  Those were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; classic, since 100VG's claim to virtue was its central controller, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its most telling characteristic was significantly lower throughput than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100BT.  About the same time came the claims of ATM gurus and sundry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would-be politicians that IP and the Internet do not work technically or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; politically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | &gt;1. The problem with congestion unresponsive traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | &gt;is becoming increasingly serious as people find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | &gt;smart ways to cheat the net.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's not likely to be a problem for at least a while.  The vast majority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are prevented from play such games by their tiny, &lt;=128 kbit/sec
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connections.  The few that have connections fat enough to do significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harm would be noticed and handled administratively, if for some reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they forget the tragedy of the commons.  Any PC users that want to break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slow-start can tell their browsers to use 40 instead of 2-4 connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when talking to the typical web page with its gazillions of blinking ads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and banners.  They don't, because it does them no good, because they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throttled by 30 kbps modem links.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ATM is no more required by the theoretical existance of naughty TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installations than analogous machinery is required by the proven existence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of SYN-bombing, echo-port attacks, etc.  If it makes sense to use ATM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because someone might cheat on slow-start, then it surely makes more sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have every router in the core detect and filter streams of SYNs, packets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from port 7 to port 7, or packets with surprising source addresses.
