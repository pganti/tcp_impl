<P>
- Neither the local nor remote applications closed the connections. If that had 
<BR>
- happened, everything would have worked out fine. This was an interactive
<BR>
- application data exchange. The remote application sent the data without 
<BR>
- the PSH bit and was waiting for a reply from the local application.
<BR>
- However, the local TCP was waiting for the PSH bit (or local CLOSE or FIN from
<BR>
- peer) which never came. This caused a connection deadlock.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me such a receiver is failing to be conservative in what it
<BR>
accepts.  It has data, and it refuses to deliver it because no PSH bit
<BR>
is present, yet we know it is acceptable for a TCP to deliver data without
<BR>
the PSH bit being set.
<BR>
<P>- Again, if a receiving TCP can't depend on the sender to set the PSH bit,
<BR>
- what would the algorithm be on when to give data to the application?
<BR>
<P>How about everything it currently has, assuming the application still offers
<BR>
receive socket buffer space?  On our systems, coalescing occurs at the
<BR>
granularity of the read()'s done by the application, not in TCP.  Every
<BR>
TCP segment which arrived since the last read, assuming it fits in the
<BR>
user's buffer, is delivered.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
