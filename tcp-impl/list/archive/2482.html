<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This problem is regarding use of  two write() call in succession. Let me explain the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem. In one of the blocking socket implementations, I have used two write calls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mainly to detect the state of the TCP connection. I can expect that if the TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection has been closed (FIN) by the http server (due to http/1.1  timeout), the
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, isn't the remote's sending of a FIN supposed to generate a
<BR>
zero-length read to inform the other side that there was at least a
<BR>
partial shutdown?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; use of two write calls in sequence at the client side should detect if the connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was closed. As normally expected, when I make the first write() call, the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would ackowledge the client with a RST since the connection was  already closed. Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I make my second write() call, in succession, the presence of RST at the client
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP should prompt the second write() to fail and return with errno to ECONNRESET. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote a small code to check this behaviour. I  ran this code in linux 2.2.16 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retrive the index.html page from an intranet web server. In this code, I made a TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection to send and retrieve the index.html file normally and then slept for about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20 seconds allowing the web server to timeout.  After 20 seconds, after the web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server had timed-out and closed the connection, I again called the two writes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (breaking the request) with the same GET HTTP/1.1 request in succession.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have some observations:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1. The second write() call in succession  does not fail. However, if I sleep for 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second in between the two writes, the second write() call fails and returns errno
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with ECONNRESET. I checked this behaviour running it in Linux2.2.16/ SunOS _5.5.1/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5.8 and the behavior remains same.  However, in Sun OS 5.7, second write() call does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not fail at all even after giving this delay. (I tried to  increase the delay, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without any result). In VxWorks 5.2, we could detect the error in the second write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call without any delay at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>As derMouse pointed-out, once you send the first segment, there is arace
<BR>
between the other side getting the RST to the sending TCP, and the
<BR>
sending app getting the second write into TCP.
<BR>
<P>As for why no delay was required in VxWorks, I'll hazard the guess that
<BR>
the system running VxWorks was slow enough that the RST arrived before
<BR>
the second segment could be sent by the app. 
<BR>
<P>As for why SunOS5.7 never got the ECONNRESET, probably a bug in 5.7.
<BR>
<P>I still think that paying attention to the zero-length read to detect
<BR>
remote (graceful) close is best. doing things that elicit RST's is not
<BR>
such a hot idea.
