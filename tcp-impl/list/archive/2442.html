<BR>
<P>WSES/IEEE International Conference on POWER ENGINEERING 
<BR>
Rethymnon, CRETE (GREECE).
<BR>
JULY 8-15, 2001
<BR>
<P>INVITATION FROM THE CHAIRMEN PROF. PECORELLI PERES AND PROF.
<BR>
LAMBERT-TORRES
<BR>
We would like to invite you for a unique opportunity to gather the
<BR>
forefront of technology with a stay in Crete, this magic island, the
<BR>
birth of the first civilization in the west european sense. You willl
<BR>
participate with engineers, professors, scientists, researches, managers
<BR>
and decision makers from all over the world who will attend this
<BR>
comprehensive technical conference devoted to electric power generation,
<BR>
transmission and distribution systems. As organizers of this Conference,
<BR>
our intention is to have a vision into the 21st  century with a high
<BR>
quality technical program where you can present and learn the latest
<BR>
topics and issues that affect the environment, the technology, the
<BR>
industry and their future. Our best congratulations and thanks to all
<BR>
professionals for attending this invitation. Your registration on this
<BR>
site is the first step to make this a memorable conference. We hope you
<BR>
enjoy not only the technical activities but also the beauty and
<BR>
hospitality of Greece, the land of the Olympic Idea and especially of
<BR>
Crete, this unique island!. All these elements assure a special scenario
<BR>
to develop fertile techinical interchanges and the friendship
<BR>
<P><P>for information and more details contact K.Ioannou :  <A HREF="mailto:ioannou@vip.gr?Subject=Re:%20(no%20subject)&In-Reply-To=&lt;3A6D9E84.AE3E0813@computers.gr&gt;">ioannou@vip.gr</A> or

<P><P>About Crete:
<BR>
CRETE is a Unique Place in the World: In this magic island, so richly
<BR>
endowed by Nature, everything is in abundance: blond beaches with
<BR>
palm-trees, cool gorgers, serene coves, palm-forests, mysterious caves,
<BR>
minoan palaces, paleochristian churches, byzantine churches, islamic
<BR>
mosques, and of course modern cosmopolitan life.
<BR>
Crete lies in the crossroads of the three ancient continents:
<BR>
Europe-Asia-Africa and the Cretan Civilization borrowed elements from
<BR>
european, asian and african world. Also, Crete, in the minoan era, gave
<BR>
birth to the first civilization in the west-european sense.
<BR>
Many famous Artists and Politicians of Greece, like El-Greco, Venizelos
<BR>
and Kornaros were born in Crete.
