<P>
Can the arguments about disk drives, memory capacity be really extended
<BR>
to core, highly shared Internet links? Has the provisioning of core
<BR>
links ever exceeded the rate at which the number of internet users are
<BR>
increasing. 
<BR>
<P>Also, should we not also consider the &quot;bandwidth&quot; of the core
<BR>
routers/switches, that is the rate at which their ability to
<BR>
route/switch packets is increasing versus the rate at which they are
<BR>
pumped with packets? Can that ability be overprovisioned quickly
<BR>
enough?
<BR>
<P>Please revert back, if I have misunderstood.
<BR>
<P>thanks
<BR>
Anumita.

<P>If you have a DSL line, track its usage. You will find that ~1Mbps is

more than sufficient most of the time.
<BR>
<P>Yes, applications sometimes catch up. However, whenever a resource is 
<BR>
scarce the assumption is that usage will always catch up. The arguments
<BR>
<P>held in the past for disk drives, memory capacity, and CPU speed. Most
<BR>
<P>are, for most purposes, overprovisioned very easily for all but a small
<BR>
<P>fraction of the time for most users.
