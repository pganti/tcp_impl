<P>
<EM>&gt; For whatever reason, when I tuned the code back to IW=1, the retransmits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; went away, even when delaying the first Ack.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm, it would be interesting to understand this better (in your copious
<BR>
spare time).  In my thesis I found that the RTT adaptation almost always
<BR>
worked correctly for BSD-derived TCPs, including SunOS.  But the slowest
<BR>
path in the study was 56 Kbps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   1: 141.211.7.31    pm035-20.dialip.mich.net. (1 ms) (1 ms) (1 ms)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  16: 137.175.2.11    volitans.MorningStar.Com. (431 ms) (237 ms) (212 ms)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note that the RTTs have quite a range.  That's why I don't trust the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulations where folks are reporting such nice numbers for IW=2.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just don't match the real world experience shown by a simple trace.
</EM><BR>
<P>Traceroute is not a &quot;simple trace&quot; in terms of RTTs.  There's noise in
<BR>
generating the ICMP Time Exceeded (this is one of the problems Van tries to
<BR>
tackle with pathchar) that has nothing to do with the network path.
<BR>
I certainly agree, though, that sometimes end-to-end packet times have a
<BR>
large amount of variation.  The key question is whether the current RTT
<BR>
algorithms, properly implemented, fail to deal with it.  The evidence
<BR>
of which I'm aware says that the BSD versions of the algorithms are
<BR>
appropriately conservative - and could be tightened considerably, though
<BR>
exactly how to do that is still a research area.
<BR>
