||This is an excellent point. The problem that I have seen with this is the
<BR>
||RTT estimates do not always work cleanly because the small packet has a much
<BR>
||smaller RTT than a larger packet would. By increasing the cwnd by packets
<BR>
||and not by bytes the RTT will not move smoothly and this will result in
<BR>
||increased retransmits while the RTT must take into account a sudden change
<BR>
||due to queueing in combination with the network latency.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||&gt; 
<BR>
||&gt; The result is that cwnd is too large, and the larger packets are
<BR>
||&gt; retransmitted, because several large packets queue for very long times
<BR>
||&gt; (&gt; 1 second).
<BR>
||&gt; 
<BR>
||&gt; I see this every day!
<BR>
||
<BR>
||I have seen this all too often as well.
<BR>

<BR>
we live with this constantly on wireless links where slowness is only
<BR>
one issue, but where lossiness is another issue, and an even worse
<BR>
issue is wildly varying RTT time.  
<BR>
<P>We have two configuration parameters we recommend for wireless customers
<BR>
who operate in these conditions
<BR>
<P>&quot;no-slow-start&quot; which does what it says and
<BR>
&quot;RTT-multiplier&quot; which multiplies the calculated RTT to smooth the
<BR>
cumulative effects of slowness, lossiness, variability in both
<BR>
media speed and packet size.  19.2K CDPD works well with no slow
<BR>
start and a RTT multiplier factor of 4.
<BR>
<P>In a perfect world, with perfect API's and a perfect operating system
<BR>
we would be able to sense all this and adjust accordingly.
