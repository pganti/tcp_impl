<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Given that the intent is to avoid a line-rate burst, the clearly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the best mechanism is &quot;monitor and limit the window allowed-to-send size&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you were previously in near steady state and near congestion, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP flow going idle would reduce the standing queue at the bottleneck.
</EM><BR>
<P>In steady state, if the TCP flow is idle for more than a RTT,
<BR>
the other 'steady state' TCPs will gobble that queue hole by
<BR>
probes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the TCP flow that went idle was not a significant contributor to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bottleneck load, then the line rate burst would not be significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relative to other traffic.  If the TCP flow was a significant or among
</EM><BR>
<P>If we knew that, we wouldn't need to avoid the line-rate bursts. 
<BR>
In general, it's the agnosticism that causes the conservative design anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Going to slow start is a very drastic move for large window TCP.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes on the order of N RTTs to reach a window of 2^N (Jamshid argues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that should be 1.5^N).  For a satellite link and a small transfer, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a long time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure - I'm not sure that this is the right solution.
<BR>
There are separable issues:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- detecting the failure of ACK clocking and thus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the potential for line-rate bursting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(which can occur with big initial windows,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or when the transmission is idle for a period)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- what to do about it
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sending large line rate bursts is bad but not terrible.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once RED is implemented, agreed. Until then, this is not the 
<BR>
case. I can grab a chunk of the queue and starve out other
<BR>
ack-clocking TCPs, which is clearly anti-social. At BEST,
<BR>
I will consume BW and router resources up to the first
<BR>
router at which I lose packets. Either way, it's a bad thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (code included)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the code above would implement the suggestion I made on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end2end-interest early today.  If you wanted to be even more
</EM><BR>
<P>Our research group here at ISI is examining this. We will implement
<BR>
a variety of algorithms (this included) and see what happens. 
<BR>
If anyone has other suggested algorithms, please post them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; burst.  While far from perfect, this would be an improvement over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current behavior short of clocking out packets on a timer.
</EM><BR>
<P>PS - as mentioned before, we have an implementation of this as well,
<BR>
called 'rate-based pacing' that clocks out packets using rate estimates
<BR>
until ACK clocking resumes. We'll compare complexity and computational 
<BR>
overhead, as well as efficiency and 'niceness'.
