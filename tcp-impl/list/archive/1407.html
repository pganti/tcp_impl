<P>
We've heard a number of people mention that it would be good to document
<BR>
some of the pitfalls &amp; problems of implementing PMTU discovery (something
<BR>
with a bit more meat than RFC 1435).  For example, one is that if an ATM
<BR>
switch doesn't have enough buffer to reassemble a bunch of cells into a
<BR>
really large packet, then it will necessarily discard the packet, and if
<BR>
the packet had DF set, it *won't* generate the necessary ICMP response
<BR>
(because it couldn't process the full packet at all), leading to a PMTU
<BR>
black hole.  (Matt Mathis pointed this one out a while back.)
<BR>
<P>Even though some of these problems aren't related to TCP implementation,
<BR>
some are, and it's not clear there's a better home for discussing them than
<BR>
tcpimpl.
<BR>
<P>So we've put on the Orlando agenda a discussion of PMTU discovery problems,
<BR>
to try to get a feel for the scope.  Neither of your esteemed WG chairs,
<BR>
though, is particularly familiar with these problems.  We'd therefore like
<BR>
to encourage discussion on the list over the next few days, so we can get
<BR>
things rolling in advance and figure out some of the common ground in order
<BR>
to cover it quickly at the meeting.  We'd also like to encourage tcpimpl'ers
<BR>
to come to the meeting prepared to discuss their favorite PMTU problems.
<BR>
<P>See you next week,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vern
