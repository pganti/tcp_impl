<P><EM>&gt;The proposed fix is to make the server: send the clean shutdown,

<P>This is old news in HTTP world - in fact (although I can't find any mails
<BR>
in the HTTP archives to show this), I believe to have first found this
<BR>
problem in early 1995 when experimenting with cross-atlantic HTTP/1.0 PUT
<BR>
requests between MIT and CERN. The problem that I saw for HTTP/1.0 PUT is
<BR>
the following:
<BR>
<P>* Client A sends a PUT request with a large body to the server
<BR>
* The server B sends back a short 401 Access Denied response
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and closes the connection in both directions.
<BR>
* A receives the response but has already sent a large part of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the body because of the RTT across the Atlantic
<BR>
* A ACK's the response but the ACK is pending behind the data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;already sent to B
<BR>
* B sees that data is still coming and sends a RST to A
<BR>
* A gets the RST and passes it up immediately to the application
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dropping the HTTP response because the seq counter hasn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been updated.
<BR>
* A gets a RST but no HTTP response - it doesn't know what happened.
<BR>
<P>At the time I talked with Dave Clark about it and he pointed out that it
<BR>
was not a bug but normal behavior.
<BR>
<P>The problem can also occur in HTTP/1.1 pipelining which we found when
<BR>
implementing this in the libwww HTTP code. This is described in an IETF
<BR>
draft by Jim Gettys and Alan Freier that was never finished [1], section 8:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In simple request/response protocols (e.g. HTTP/1.0), a server can go
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ahead and close both receive and transmit sides of its connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simultaneously whenever it needs to. A pipelined or streaming
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol (e.g. HTTP/1.1) connection, is more complex [Frystyk et.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;al.], and an implementation which does so can create major problems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenario is as follows: an HTTP/1.1 client talking to a HTTP/1.1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server starts pipelining a batch of requests, for example 15 on an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open TCP connection.  The server decides that it will not serve more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than 5 requests per connection and closes the TCP connection in both
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directions after it successfully has served the first five requests.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 10 requests that are already sent from the client will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with client generated TCP ACK packets arrive on a closed port
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the server. This &quot;extra&quot; data causes the server's TCP to issue a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reset which makes the client TCP stack pass the last ACK'ed packet to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the client application and discard all other packets. This means that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP responses that are either being received or already have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received successfully but haven't been ACK'ed will be dropped by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client TCP. In this situation the client does not have any means of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finding out which HTTP messages were successful or even why the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server closed the connection. The server may have generated a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Connection: Close&quot; header in the 5th response but the header may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been lost due to the TCP reset. Servers must therefore close
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each half of the connection independently.
<BR>
<P>This has in HTTP/1.1 rev 6 [2] been moved to section 10.4
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the client is sending data, a server implementation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using TCP SHOULD be careful to ensure that the client
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledges receipt of the packet(s) containing the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response, before the server closes the input connection.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the client continues sending data to the server after
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input buffers before they can be read and interpreted by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the HTTP application.
<BR>
<P>I believe that all modern HTTP servers in fact do the half-close. However,
<BR>
this is not without problems as the server also has to be able to protect
<BR>
itself. It therefore has to have some feeling of a &quot;reasonable lingering
<BR>
time&quot; for the connection.
