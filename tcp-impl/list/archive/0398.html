Dave,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     If the broken hosts are mostly things like terminal servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     that only initiate connections, then I don't see a problem with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     always sending a Window Scale in the initial SYN.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Lexmart printer I mentioned earlier is a counter-example.  Having
<BR>
to power-cycle the box is a drastic result.  So we made disabling
<BR>
window scaling (and with it, timestamps) an easy configuration option.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     I think that it is perfectly reasonable for the application to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     be able to directly set the Window Scale value, rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     having it just be automatically calculated as a side effect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     setting a large recieve buffer, which also causes your initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     advertised window to be large.  It's the difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     what the application wants to be able to use, vs. what it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     wants to use right now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Consider the application FTP.  Configure the application with large buffers
<BR>
and window scaling enabled.  Now FTP to new and old hosts.  New hosts will
<BR>
work fine.  Old hosts will not establish the session.  How can you configure
<BR>
this application (FTP) to use large buffers and window scaling with the new
<BR>
hosts, and still talk to the old hosts?  Even the application level is not
<BR>
fine enough control for this situation.
<BR>
<P>Fred
