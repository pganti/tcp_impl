CHRISTAIN BASSEY
<BR>
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. 
<BR>
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. 
<BR>
UNION BANK PLC
<BR>
MARINA- LAGOS – NIGERIA 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><P>Dear Sir, 
<BR>
<P>I am christain bassey, the director in charge of
<BR>
auditing
<BR>
and accounting 
<BR>
section of  Union Bank Lagos Republic of Nigeria  with
<BR>
due respect and 
<BR>
regard. I have decided to contact you on a business
<BR>
transaction that will 
<BR>
be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the
<BR>
transaction. 
<BR>
<P>During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my
<BR>
department came 
<BR>
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a
<BR>
deceased person who died 
<BR>
on November 1997 in a plane crash and the fund has
<BR>
been dormant in his 
<BR>
account with this Bank without any claim of the fund
<BR>
in our custody 
<BR>
either from his family or relation before our
<BR>
discovery to this 
<BR>
development. 
<BR>
<P>Although personally, I keep this information secret
<BR>
within myself and 
<BR>
partners to enable the whole plans and idea be
<BR>
profitable and 
<BR>
successful. During the time of execution. The said
<BR>
amount was us$4.5M(four 
<BR>
million Five hundred thousand United States dollars).
<BR>
As it may interest you 
<BR>
to know, I got your impressive information through the
<BR>
business 
<BR>
directory at chamber of commerce and Industry here in
<BR>
Lagos - Nigeria where I 
<BR>
was searching for a good reliable contact to do the
<BR>
business with. I 
<BR>
was elated the time I saw your address to propose the
<BR>
business to you. 
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over
<BR>
this fund as the 
<BR>
bonafide next of kin to the deceased person , get the
<BR>
required approval 
<BR>
and transfer this money to a foreign account  been put
<BR>
in place and 
<BR>
directives and needed information will be relayed to
<BR>
you as soon as you 
<BR>
indicate your interest and willingness to assist us
<BR>
and also benefit your 
<BR>
self to this great business opportunity. In fact I
<BR>
could have done this 
<BR>
deal alone but because of my position in this country
<BR>
as a civil 
<BR>
servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign
<BR>
account and would eventually 
<BR>
raise an eye brow on my side during the time of
<BR>
transfer because I work 
<BR>
in this bank. 
<BR>
<P>This is the actual reason why it will require a second
<BR>
party or fellow 
<BR>
who will forward claims as the next of kin with
<BR>
affidavit of trust of 
<BR>
oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account
<BR>
where he will need 
<BR>
the money to be re-transferred into on his request as
<BR>
it may be after 
<BR>
due verification and clarification by the
<BR>
correspondent branch of the 
<BR>
bank, where the whole money will be remitted from to
<BR>
your own designation 
<BR>
bank account. I will not fail to inform you that these
<BR>
transactions is 
<BR>
100% risks free. 
<BR>
<P><P>On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be
<BR>
entitled to 30% 
<BR>
of the total sum as gratification, while 70% will be
<BR>
for my partners and 
<BR>
me. Please, you have been advised to keep top secret
<BR>
as we are still in 
<BR>
service and intend to retire from service after we
<BR>
conclude this deal 
<BR>
with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation
<BR>
here in this bank 
<BR>
until you confirm the money in your account and ask us
<BR>
to come down to 
<BR>
your country for subsequent sharing of the fund
<BR>
according to percentages 
<BR>
previously indicated and further investment, either in
<BR>
your country or 
<BR>
any country you advice us to invest in. 
<BR>
<P>All other necessary information will be sent to you
<BR>
when I hear from 
<BR>
you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible
<BR>
stating your wish 
<BR>
in this deal. On my Email number: Any expenses been
<BR>
incurred by you  or  
<BR>
me  should  be deducted  before  our  normal  sharing 
<BR>
of the  fund  
<BR>
<P>Best Regard, 
<BR>
CHRIATAIN BASSEY.
