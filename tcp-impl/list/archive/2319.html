<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Only if they're trying to hack your statistics or debugging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;I don't think (pls correct me if this is not the case) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;anyone is proposing different receiver actions based on these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;codes; it's just for diagnoses, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Any information shot back to the sender of a SYN is potential information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for a hacker. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes! A SYN/ACK is info, the window size is info, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How does this _add_ compromises, is the question...
</EM><BR>
<P>The info you listed is non-critical.
<BR>
<P>What I meant were the specific codes that have been suggested, such as
<BR>
&quot;application abort&quot;, &quot;bad precedence&quot;, &quot;bad security&quot;, &quot;low memory&quot;, etc.
<BR>
This type of information is quite interesting for someone trying to do
<BR>
damage. All he would need to do is repeat the same SYN ad nauseum, and
<BR>
if he keeps getting &quot;application abort&quot;, he is well on his way to crash
<BR>
your server. Is this compromise enough?
<BR>
<P>Responding with &quot;bad precedence&quot; or &quot;bad security&quot; is synonymous with inviting
<BR>
him to try a few other values. This _adds_ compromise.
<BR>
<P>A simple empty RST doesn't give him any of this information so he doesn't know
<BR>
if you are just not listening on that port or that you rejected his attempt.
<BR>
He can't use the information of why you rejected a particular connection attempt
<BR>
against you because he doesn't know it. Adding a code to the RST provides this
<BR>
attacker with the information he needs to fine-tune his attack to bring your
<BR>
server down.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;If you're that worried about hackers, use IPSEC.
</EM><BR>
<P>Regarding IPSEC, remember that there are many reasons to use TCP _without_ IPSEC,
<BR>
a web server is a good example. We (or at least I) want to be able to build boxes
<BR>
that are sturdy enough and can withstand some attacks. A code in an RST sent in
<BR>
response to a SYN or SYN/ACK as suggested just adds vulnerabilities.
<BR>
<P>Again, sending RST information elsewhere in the state machine doesn't bother me
<BR>
as much.
<BR>
<P>I _do_ see the debugging value in the idea, but I worry that it opens Pandora's box.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
