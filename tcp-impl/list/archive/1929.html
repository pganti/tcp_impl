The Next Era Web of Multimedia Data-stream
<BR>
Transmission Solution of the Internet!
<BR>
<P>By Robert Tan
<BR>
Update: 1999. 11. 22
<BR>
<P>For the many more format and definite of standard of digital film and
<BR>
video, digital audio
<BR>
and the other multimedia data stream of tomorrow, the existing network
<BR>
technology including
<BR>
the modern internet webs will be fabulous and difficult to transmit it
<BR>
for us. The Endpoint
<BR>
Congestion almost resistant our viewer area full of the entire world, We
<BR>
would need the
<BR>
straightway link of the multi-media data-stream in real-time for us.
<BR>
Would you like to get a lower cost &amp; more effective digital signal
<BR>
channel in a wide-bandwidth
<BR>
or broadband hybrid coax cable system? For the FTTX, HFC networks,
<BR>
especially in the HFC
<BR>
networks with the 256QAM or 64VSB digital modulation technology systems,
<BR>
the SSB-ASK or the
<BR>
VSB-ASK technology transmission systems would be used normally. The
<BR>
Flash Bandwidth 1KHZ to
<BR>
100MHz digital control a variable frequency bandwidth, it is
<BR>
high-performance anti-alias &amp;
<BR>
reconstruction (FBW) filter, it will be able to provide a variable
<BR>
multiplex sub-frequency
<BR>
band in any broadband HFC system. With the FDM assistant digital carry
<BR>
system and SSB or VSB
<BR>
signal channel, a group of FBW filters will provide separate
<BR>
multi-frequency bands in spectrum
<BR>
without any cross talking and distortion by a large frequency range in a
<BR>
high-speed high-
<BR>
effective transmission system. In a FTTX or HFC web, this digital
<BR>
controlled signal channel
<BR>
would have a very large frequency spectrum changed dynamic range. For a
<BR>
large client group,
<BR>
such as the Broadband Cable Internet Access or HFC users, one of them
<BR>
would like to get a
<BR>
variable data speed according to the applications of his needed. It will
<BR>
provide a lot of
<BR>
digital control frequency bandwidth which is separated one another in
<BR>
HFC transmission system,
<BR>
and it will more effective for the &quot;hot clients&quot;, such as the VOD video
<BR>
clients or the other
<BR>
high-code rate users and high-speed data stream user's applications. The
<BR>
FBW will improve the
<BR>
speed of the data stream, diminish the amount of the spare resource
<BR>
seizing of &quot;Cool Clients&quot;,
<BR>
reduce the calculations of the DSP processor of the center web main
<BR>
switching system and the
<BR>
branch switching system. Reduce the CPU utilities of the applications in
<BR>
all of client
<BR>
communication adapter and its cost of produce is very important. The
<BR>
&quot;Cool Clients&quot; mains
<BR>
the IP telephone users or the other lower speed code rate audio
<BR>
applications. Anyway, the
<BR>
speed of the up-stream data and down-stream data speed could be changed
<BR>
to any value you
<BR>
needed, and the changing degree will be very smoothly and very simply in
<BR>
writing one or
<BR>
two bytes in the command system of communication web switcher. By the
<BR>
high-speed frequency
<BR>
variable characteristic, if the FBW filter were used in your FTTX or HFC
<BR>
switching system,
<BR>
the upward and downward data stream speed could be managed and attempted
<BR>
by your command
<BR>
system. So that, the transmission bandwidth will be able to adjusted to
<BR>
your needed in any
<BR>
time within one millionth second. The real-time will be very more
<BR>
improved and more effective
<BR>
on the communication main roads such as FTTX and HFC system,
<BR>
transmission controlling system
<BR>
will completely control the data stream in real-time.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Dear Technology Research and Development Administrator:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an electronic engineer in the field of Analog and Digital
<BR>
filters researching and
<BR>
designing. I had been a DSP engineer for ten years. My development field
<BR>
is electronic circuits
<BR>
-- digital and analog hardware designing and researching in applications
<BR>
of Digital Signal
<BR>
Processing. My works contains the frequency spectrum analysis, digital
<BR>
audio and digital video
<BR>
systems, noise spectrum controlling and processing, and the other
<BR>
military applications. I have
<BR>
researched and designed several kind of analog and digital anti-alias &amp;
<BR>
reconstruction filters.
<BR>
A few years before, in my R&amp;D works, I find the special frequency of the
<BR>
filters is usually
<BR>
fixed, it could be very difficult to change the cutoff frequency of the
<BR>
low-pass anti-alias
<BR>
&amp; reconstruction filter. But the fixed filter could not suit the target
<BR>
of my technical
<BR>
applications. If we want to get several special frequency of the
<BR>
filters, we must to use
<BR>
several different fixed filters or instead of fixed filter with
<BR>
switching capacity filter
<BR>
or digital filter, such as IIR or FIR filter, and their frequency must
<BR>
be variable in order
<BR>
to change the analysis frequency. It is very important for the spectrum
<BR>
analysis system and
<BR>
the digital random real time vibrated controlling system. But, in this
<BR>
way, we must pay for
<BR>
digital IIR or FIR filter, it is very expensive in the price, take a
<BR>
large space for the DSP
<BR>
chips and its outside memory banks to install it. So, we would get into
<BR>
much troubles and
<BR>
complex questions from a simple problem.
<BR>
However, we have the switching capacity technologies, and the product of
<BR>
up to 8th order
<BR>
filters is a very normally used. But the switching capacity filter will
<BR>
have a high noise
<BR>
and low frequency range, and it has a non-exactly special frequency,
<BR>
generally. The special
<BR>
frequency of most of the switching capacity filters is from 1/95 to
<BR>
1/105 times of its main
<BR>
switching clock and it is difficult to improve its accuracy. Actually,
<BR>
the switching capacity
<BR>
filter circuit is very difficult to adjust and use in applications.
<BR>
Anywise, its order is
<BR>
normally below 8th order, and the special frequency and bandwidth of the
<BR>
switching capacity
<BR>
filters is below to 50KHz, and the amplitude response is not exactly
<BR>
yet, the dynamic range
<BR>
of the amplitude is very low, normally, it is below the 48dB. Except of
<BR>
frequency range from
<BR>
0 to 50Hz, in this field, its dynamic range is lower than 30 dB and not
<BR>
usefully, it is
<BR>
normally being used in the speech processing circuit and the other lower
<BR>
frequency band
<BR>
processing systems. Attention, all of this analysis is not including the
<BR>
phase noise of the
<BR>
main switching clock and the noise of clock feed through yet. The
<BR>
others, it is difficult to
<BR>
get much more analysis frequency bands or special frequency points for
<BR>
the switching capacity
<BR>
filters, it is especially for the higher frequency band which is
<BR>
approached to the top
<BR>
frequency point. All of these characteristics of the switching capacity
<BR>
filters will restrict
<BR>
its applications in the area of modern digital communications.
<BR>
The others method of the filters designing is the contact-time analog
<BR>
filter .I have found
<BR>
some method. It could make many transfer functions. Such as the
<BR>
elliptical function,
<BR>
Chebyshev function and Butterworth function, but there is some
<BR>
interesting things here,
<BR>
it is that the same circuit frame could be built into many transfer
<BR>
functions, and it
<BR>
would have programmable (digital controlled) special frequency. Changing
<BR>
special frequency
<BR>
on line is available. It could get the very wide frequency range, very
<BR>
quickly to change
<BR>
the used band, and the digital controlled circuit is very directly and
<BR>
simply, the special
<BR>
frequency step is very smoothly (because the Frequency is controlled by
<BR>
long bit Digital
<BR>
multiplier). In that points, integrate the FBW filter circuit technology
<BR>
is very useful
<BR>
for the digital controlling and processing systems. Because of the
<BR>
Digital Controlling
<BR>
Flash Bandwidth Filer (FBW) is depend on a few chips of high quality 8
<BR>
or 12 bits long
<BR>
Digital Multiplier and a few chips of high-speed amplifiers. The other,
<BR>
this filter
<BR>
technology is used with a few exactitude resistors and exactitude
<BR>
capacitors also. For
<BR>
example, an 8th order elliptical filter need 8chips of dual Digital
<BR>
Multiplier and several
<BR>
chips high bandwidth amplifiers, 8chips exactitude capacitors and
<BR>
several chips exactitude
<BR>
resisters. If it is possible, integrating all the Digital Multiplier and
<BR>
amplifiers into
<BR>
one chip or one plastic package (mixed circuit), place all the
<BR>
exactitude resistors and
<BR>
capacitors out of the package. It will be finest filter and very easy to
<BR>
used and could
<BR>
be re-designed agilely by the customers and the OEMs. The parameter of
<BR>
the filters is
<BR>
depending on the value of the resistors and the capacitors. Its value
<BR>
could be designed
<BR>
by the customs freely and calculated by constant functions directly, and
<BR>
that is very
<BR>
simply.
<BR>
And then, the FBW filters would be very usefully in the FTTX or HFC
<BR>
networks. For working
<BR>
with the 256QAM or 64VSB modulation technology and any narrow-band
<BR>
transmission technology
<BR>
systems, such as the Broadband Cable Internet Access webs, HDTV or SDTV
<BR>
and VOD systems, it
<BR>
would compress the used frequency bandwidth in mostly extent. Because of
<BR>
the WAN systems in
<BR>
any nations will be depending on the &quot;Tree structures&quot; as the main road
<BR>
in the webs in the
<BR>
future. The frequency source is very expensive in this web, It would be
<BR>
welcomed in the
<BR>
Internet web digital information transmission, exchanging and switching
<BR>
technology area,
<BR>
DSP area and digital communications area, such as MAN and WAN coax cable
<BR>
webs or the FTTX
<BR>
system applications. Any way, the most of modern networking transmission
<BR>
mode is TDM. It
<BR>
is very suitable for the text material or media, because of it is a
<BR>
fixed media in size,
<BR>
and it is the fixed continue time in length and generation procedure.
<BR>
But the most of
<BR>
multimedia is not to be suitable with that. The data stream of voice and
<BR>
video will have
<BR>
no constant size to be forecasted has no constant procedure time. It is
<BR>
only have a constant
<BR>
and fixed bandwidth of media data stream. Because of your interesting
<BR>
points is onto the
<BR>
generations and the procedures of the video or audio information of thus
<BR>
material or the
<BR>
news, such as the high quality digital cinema, digital musicale and so
<BR>
on. Certainly, you
<BR>
could take the any multimedia information and any moving picture on you
<BR>
desktop through the
<BR>
Internet Web. It will be appeared the true alive world with you in any
<BR>
site you can go! So
<BR>
that, the only one of best way of the media data streams transmission
<BR>
and exchanging is the
<BR>
FDM mode with the SSB-ASK or VSB-ASK technology, it should be working
<BR>
with the QAM or
<BR>
VSB- ASK digital modulation technology in the future Internet webs.
<BR>
FBW filter would be used in most of switchers and routers, which is
<BR>
depending on the FDM
<BR>
technologies. For the cable TV systems STB (set top box), video &amp; audio
<BR>
servers in Broadband
<BR>
Cable Internet Access, cable modems or the client-end adapters in the
<BR>
most of family users
<BR>
and the most of business cable users in the world will need a very great
<BR>
deal of broadband
<BR>
web transmission bandwidth. Because of that, in any modern
<BR>
home-electronic equipment, such
<BR>
as the Internet officers, shopping's and the VOD or the other broadband
<BR>
information
<BR>
electronics, its using method would be depending on the FDM switching
<BR>
technologies. So that,
<BR>
the &quot;Online Home-Electronics&quot; or the other Internet accessing products
<BR>
which is used in
<BR>
people's homes would be simply to operate and easy to use. And it must
<BR>
be depend on the
<BR>
simply low-layer hardware equipment and protocols of the webs, such as
<BR>
the VOD systems
<BR>
and the STB terminals in the Broadband Cable Internet Access or HFC
<BR>
networks. The FBW
<BR>
technology would provide us more applicable and useable method in the
<BR>
physics layer of
<BR>
the public HFC networks, its FDM applications in a broadband web get us
<BR>
in a lower building
<BR>
price, more effective than the other technology. Such as the Broadband
<BR>
Cable Internet Access
<BR>
webs, HFC networks, FTTX networks, and the other and the other WAN
<BR>
public broadband networks
<BR>
would have a very great applications of the FBW filters.
<BR>
The others, using a Flash-Band-width filter will help you get in to a
<BR>
fully data stream
<BR>
bandwidth management of any expensive data-link channels and the very
<BR>
expensive communication
<BR>
data stream bandwidth, such as the communication data-link of the
<BR>
satellite communication
<BR>
systems, and the ocean bottom communication systems. FBW filter will
<BR>
control the any leased
<BR>
data-stream bandwidth in dynamic mode within a very large frequency
<BR>
range, a large range of
<BR>
signal frequency bandwidth and data-stream speed in any time for a
<BR>
communication administration
<BR>
and operation system. It will change the bandwidth with you leased data
<BR>
stream very imminently
<BR>
within several microsecond, improve your expensive bandwidth of
<BR>
data-stream transmission channel,
<BR>
save your leased payment and money cost for any customers of digital
<BR>
communications and any
<BR>
Tele-communication operating and service company. It will hold any
<BR>
important transmission of
<BR>
data-stream in smoothly and take it freely. So, in this system, any
<BR>
interrupt of your
<BR>
communication data stream will be never.
