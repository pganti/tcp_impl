<P>
So, I've been thinking about TCP idle restarts based on the reading of
<BR>
both tcpimpl-prob-05 (paxson, et al..) and tcpimpl-restart-00 (hughes,
<BR>
touch, heidemann exp 09/98).. and something doesn't feel right.
<BR>
<P>I offer up this narrative in case I've not grasped something correctly
<BR>
and someone wants to do the kind favor of setting me straight before I
<BR>
go much further. This rambles a bit, but it does capture my thinking on the
<BR>
topic. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a heuristic pov, the purpose of congestion control is to
</EM><BR>
dynamically rate limit the pace of a stream to match the current
<BR>
capacity characteristics of the underlying medium. Because both
<BR>
contention for that medium is changing and the medium itself may
<BR>
change (due to routing adjustments) this must be constantly
<BR>
re-evaluated. TCP's basic approach is to race forward to about 1/2 of
<BR>
what it thinks the limit might be, and then inch upwards until it gets
<BR>
rebuked. This creates some kind of rolling estimate of an acceptable
<BR>
send rate based on a feedback loop from the network. 
<BR>
<P>After a period of inactivity this estimate becomes less useful due to
<BR>
lack of recent pertinent feedback. Traditional implementations react
<BR>
to this by re-entering slow start which in effect re-discovers the
<BR>
current available bandwidth. Alternatively, [Hughes,Touch,Heidemann]
<BR>
suggest Congestion Window Monitoring which fundamentally imposes a
<BR>
'use it or lose it' policy on growing CWNDs that are in excess of 4
<BR>
plus the amount of outstanding data which would ensure that after an
<BR>
idle period the cwnd is maxed out at 4.
<BR>
<P>The basic issue at hand is that the past performance of the network is
<BR>
being used to predict the future. It is recognized that the longer the
<BR>
interval between past input and the current decision time is, the less
<BR>
reliable that data is for making the decision. However, traditional
<BR>
reaction to this issue uses a simple 2 step function (valid/not valid)
<BR>
to make that determination. The only input to this decision is RTO, which
<BR>
in my opinion exerts a counter-productive force on the decision. For
<BR>
two links with the same average RTT the link with the greater variance
<BR>
is going to fall into the 'valid data' step more than the one with a
<BR>
lesser variance. In essence, this increases the likelihood of using
<BR>
past data to predict the future on a link that has proven _more_
<BR>
volatile (and thus less likely to obey past patterns of
<BR>
behavior). That doesn't seem like a good thing.
<BR>
<P>On a gut level, I'm not much of a fan of CWM either.. While leaky
<BR>
bucket scenarios are attractive to me, CWM essentially enforces a
<BR>
gushing bucket where sending capacity is throttled quickly back if the
<BR>
sending rate doesn't equal the ack-reception rate. It strikes me as
<BR>
over-aggressive... using 4 as a fall back instead of 1 is likely meant
<BR>
to mitigate this, but I dislike the constants as they cannot apply
<BR>
well to all mediums current or future.. (the increased use of
<BR>
satellite services for downstream in use for things like DirectPC and
<BR>
rural African service exhibit huge bandwidth delay properties that are
<BR>
un-necessarily crippled by this)
<BR>
<P>I think there needs to be a little more discussion on the types of
<BR>
timeouts that are realistic. Discussion generally just cites HTTP/1.1
<BR>
and leaves it at that. I see several different scenarios within just
<BR>
HTTP and also suspect NNTP exhibits relevant behavior. Some possible sources:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Short timeouts.. probably as a result of document retrieval,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parsing time, and subsequent requests for embedded objects.. Just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how long this takes depends on a lot of things of course, not the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least of which are document composition and client
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation.. but it's probably on the order of 10RTT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* longer timeouts.. the result of human interpretation of past
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results and the subsequent request to follow one of the presented
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;related references.. on the order of a few whole seconds.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Folks reading news with NNTP (as opposed to NNTP used for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transport) are going to exhibit patterns similar to the HTTP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longer timeout mentioned above.. more and more private news servers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are being introduced into the fabric of the web for use as a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussion medium, but for security/demand reasons are not propagated in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any kind of general purpose fashion, so interactive news reading
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is becoming more of a WAN phenomenon.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* HTTP cache interaction.. particularly pre-emptive retrieval
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scenarios that propagate information between caches.
<BR>
<P>I think the essence of the problem is the overloading of burst
<BR>
management and flow rate control onto a single mechanism. A large,
<BR>
previously established, cwnd may have been achieved through an earlier
<BR>
long sustained flow and slowly ramped up. Even if the properties of
<BR>
that link have not changed there is no guarantee that the link can
<BR>
support a full cwnd burst presented all at once without dropping
<BR>
packets. However it's quite possible that it can, as well and in the
<BR>
case of large bandwidth*delay links that is really something that
<BR>
should be taken advantage of.
<BR>
<P>So for the sake of clarity, I want to remove the concept of burst
<BR>
control from the discussion of restart algorithms. Perhaps a 'burst
<BR>
window' or other such technique can be orthogonally implemented to
<BR>
address the issue (something that would learn in a similar fashion
<BR>
what the maximum allowable network burst would be).
<BR>
<P>Moving back to idle algorithms I would like to experiment with
<BR>
something adaptive.. maybe a cwnd reduction of 20% (min 1 segment) for
<BR>
every A-4D elapsed in the idle period (apply in a compounding
<BR>
fashion).. This reverses the impact of the variance mentioned above
<BR>
while providing more fine grained input into the 'trust' process.
<BR>
<P>While I intend to go ahead in looking at this, I'm soliciting any
<BR>
helpful insights or 'been there done that' comments folks may have.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
