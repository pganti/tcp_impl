Why get rid of them? Limit the number of connections you track, overwrite
<BR>
old ones with new ones. That way, you never need a timer thread. It may be
<BR>
that occasionally you drop a good connection (because of hash collision),
<BR>
but that might not be a problem? (It isn't clear what you're doing with
<BR>
these connections.)
<BR>
<P>Another method is to use a separate timer queue. Whenever you see packets
<BR>
for a connection, move that connection to the end of the timer queue (with
<BR>
doubling linked lists, this should be relatively inexpensive?). Now, your
<BR>
timer thread only needs to check if the first one on the list is &quot;old&quot; and
<BR>
if it is drop it (and look at the next until no more to drop). This approach
<BR>
is also nice if you need to limit the number of connections for once you
<BR>
reach the limit and you have a new connection, just drop the one at the head
<BR>
of the queue (it's the oldest connection). NOTE: As a performance boost, if
<BR>
you keep your timers fairly granular (say in 10 seconds chunks), you might
<BR>
also add an optimization to not move a the packet to end of the list if it
<BR>
has been moved recently (in the same timer chunk). That may occasionally
<BR>
cause problems, but it may save a lot of queue moves.

<P><P>Hi Alan,
<BR>
&nbsp;I am sorry I had not been very specific. The device I intend to support is
<BR>
kind of a firewall which does not have a stack on it. It will create the
<BR>
session entries based on the packets which flow through it ot other
<BR>
machines.
<BR>
SO, it is the internal data structures which I need to clear. To put it a
<BR>
different fashion :
<BR>
<P>There is a cache to which I add entries whenever a new session starts. The
<BR>
problem is identifying the sessions in the cache which have timed out
<BR>
without
<BR>
using a timer thread to go through all the entries.
<BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
Proneet.
