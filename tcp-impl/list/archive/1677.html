&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let X and Y the lowest and the highest sequence numbers transmitted when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast Recovery is called. X is lost.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Z be the highest sequence number between X and Y that is also lost.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the source receives the partial ACK asking for packet Z, it has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transmitted new packets until T whith T&gt;Y.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it retransmits Z and may be some new packets beyond T. Packet Z
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrives at the destination which must ack all the packets till T if they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are correctly received of course. Suppose that a packet between Y and T
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is also lost, call it U, we have the following figure
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X  [Z]  Y  [U]  T
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the source receives an ACK asking for packet U. If it resets the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dupacks counter after leaving fast recovery and if the number of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segments sent after T is less than three, the detection of the loss of U
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requires a timeout. Recall that all the dupack of segments X till T have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been already received when the ack asking for segment U arrived. However
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the source uses the dupack counter as proposed by Marcel, it will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the dup acks of packets sent between U and T with any dup ack
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a packet sent after T. This may also cause a failure of Fast
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retransmit if the number of these dup acks is less than three. However
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this proposition is better than resetting the counter because it takes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account of dup acks for packets between U and T.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose here that the source should retransmit directly packet U
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without waiting for three dupack or timeout. At least one round trip
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time has passed since the transmission of U and it is very probable that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is lost. How to do this??
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chadi
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure your argument is correct.
<BR>
<P>Lets assume that U = T. What if Z is retransmitted immediately after U?
<BR>
On their way to the receiver, Z and U get reordered, Z is received first and
<BR>
an ACK asking for U is send back to the source. Immediately after that,
<BR>
U is acked in a separate ACK message. The two acks are received by the source
<BR>
in the order they were sent. Upon receiving the first of the two ACKs, U is
<BR>
retransmitted unnecessarily.
<BR>
<P>In the following, U != T.
<BR>
I believe you can use your idea only to fast retransmit the packets beyond Y
<BR>
that were sent before V, where V is the packet with the highest sequence
<BR>
number between X and Z, that was lost. In other words, you can fast
<BR>
retransmit U if T is the highest new packet sent before the retransmision
<BR>
of V, where X [V] [Z] Y [U] T.
<BR>
<P>A second case when it is safe to fast retransmit U is when there are at
<BR>
least two packets between U and T. In this case, there are three packets
<BR>
between U and the retransmission of Z and it is safe to ignore packet
<BR>
reordering.
<BR>
(This second case will be handled correctly by Reno/NewReno and U will be
<BR>
fast retransmitted because dupacks &gt;= 3 when the ACK asking for U is received).
<BR>
<P>Please correct me if I'm wrong.
<BR>
<P>If my understanding of NewReno is correct, the first retransmission is protected
<BR>
by the first three duplicate ACKs, while the next retransmissions are protected
<BR>
by the &quot;at least one roundtrip&quot; argument. Once you exit the window, you are
<BR>
protected by the &quot;at least one roundtrip&quot; argument only in the special case
<BR>
described above. Otherwise, you need to wait for the three dup acks.
<BR>
<P>In my proposal, you fast retransmit only when protected by three dup ACKs,
<BR>
when you're inside or outside the window.
