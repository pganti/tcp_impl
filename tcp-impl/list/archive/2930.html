Subject: Re: FWD:: Re: [e2e] Re: Question on &quot;identification&quot; field of IP
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mean that anyone who clears the DF bit gets what they deserve - a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonfunctioning brick.
</EM><BR>
<P>The most common scenario in my experience is VPN boxes not 
<BR>
copying DF when they encapsulate a TCP packet into an IPSEC header.
<BR>
<P>The reason is that doing so would require working path mtu discovery
<BR>
to the TCP sender to tell it about the smaller MTU, and path mtu
<BR>
discovery is often broken due to packet filters blocking all of
<BR>
ICMP or NAT gateways not properly rewriting ICMP frag-needed.
<BR>
<P>This has the same effect in the network. Worse as noted earlier
<BR>
in the thread some routers do not send enough headers
<BR>
to reconstruct the original sender after IPSEC decapsulation.
<BR>
<P>(I don't know if it is still the case but at one point routers
<BR>
from a particular popular router vendor were notorious for this
<BR>
in their default configuration - they only returned 64bits of 
<BR>
payload)
<BR>
<P>The worst part is that many IPSEC implementations drop ICMPs
<BR>
for security reasons when they don't contain the full
<BR>
original packet, because it is impossible to authenticate
<BR>
it otherwise (and they would be vunerable to a DoS of 
<BR>
an attacker forcing an unusable small MTU on them with
<BR>
forged ICMPs).
<BR>
<P>ICMPs are only required to fill up 576 bytes to avoid
<BR>
fragmentation, but TCP packets tend to be much bigger
<BR>
than that. In fact the ICMP cannot be bigger than
<BR>
the MTU and when the MTU the TCP/IPSEC packet was 
<BR>
formatted for is the same as the ICMP is sending then
<BR>
the ICMP sender has no choice but to drop some part of
<BR>
the payload because the ICMP header takes space too (or fragment, 
<BR>
which is forbidden)
<BR>
<P>The only alternative they have is to not copy DF and don't
<BR>
do path MTU discovery. Of course for a common scenario
<BR>
(VPN gateway receiving and sending on the same MTU) 
<BR>
after adding the IPSEC header this results in getting
<BR>
every full sized packet being fragmented into two
<BR>
packets. This disturbs all the TCP packet accounting
<BR>
mechanisms and makes the connection react very badly
<BR>
to any packet loss.
