<EM>&gt; That's what Solaris has (not delaying the ack of the first data segment)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for years, and one of the reason why we didn't discover the IW=1 vs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delayed-ack interoperability hiccup sooner (because we don't see this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Solaris to Solaris testing).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We were compelled to add a new tcp tunable &quot;tcp_slow_start_initial&quot; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Solaris 2.6 in order to circumvent this problem. For a complete story,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check out the following web page:

<P><P><P>I have developed a TCP simulation model that works as described in
<BR>
RFC2001 (+other RFCs). I have observed some strange start-up behaviour
<BR>
with TCP, which is related to the above, but to do with ssthresh, and
<BR>
not the initial window, IW.
<BR>
<P>I have a system with an Ethernet feeding into buffer (= a bridge or
<BR>
router) which transmits at slow speed (e.g. 64kbps).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The window opens quite quickly, fills up the buffer, and delays go up
<BR>
quickly, resulting in time-outs and re-transmissions. For a few seconds
<BR>
the system is OK, but then it becomes highly congested, but eventually
<BR>
settles down.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic problem is that ssthresh is set to 65535 bytes, and hence
<BR>
the cwnd initially opens (almost) exponentially fast, filling the
<BR>
upstream buffer quickly.
<BR>
<P>A solution is to set ssthresh = 1 (MSS). This gives a more controlled
<BR>
(linear) start-up. But, in a high speed network I guess that such a
<BR>
change would be detrimental (we want the window to open quickly).
<BR>
<P><P>I have only simulated this, so does anyone have comments on whether is
<BR>
is:
<BR>
<P>a) a real effect
<BR>
b) a bug in my understanding
<BR>
c) a bug in my model
