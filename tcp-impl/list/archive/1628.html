<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:braden@ISI.EDU?Subject=Re:%20revised%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902270048.RAA07199@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">braden@ISI.EDU</A>

<P><EM>&gt;   *&gt;     However, no one has reported any harm done to any network by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt;     applications that have set TCP_NODELAY.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is a niggle, but the Nagle algorithm  made a significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contribution to avoiding Internet meltdown in the early days when there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a lot of character-at-a-time telnet traffic and &quot;high speed&quot; was 56
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kbps. I suspect there may still be some local Internet regions where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its contribution is significant, but you are correct that I have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data to prove it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree on all counts except for the first 4 words.  I phrased what I said
<BR>
intentionally.  TCP_NODELAY did not exist before the Nagle algorithm, when
<BR>
the problems it fixed were (I assume) rampant.  I believe that it would
<BR>
be a Bad Thing(tm) if the Nagle algorithm were off by default.  I believe
<BR>
making the Nagle algorighm on by default in RFC 1122 was a Good Thing(tm)
<BR>
that reduces the number of packets, CPU cycles spent on packets, and
<BR>
bandwidth spent on headers, and at the trivial cost of forcing people to
<BR>
stop and think about tinygrams, and then do something explicit if they
<BR>
really need them.
<BR>
<P>That is different from believing that any reportable harm has been done
<BR>
to any network by any program that used TCP_NODELAY (or equivalent) to
<BR>
turn off the Nagle algorithm.  I believe there's plenty of junk code that
<BR>
unnecessarily send()'s tinygrams and even plenty of junk that also bogusly
<BR>
turns off Nagle.  However, that does not imply any harm has been done.
<BR>
Junk is usually too broken in other ways to harm the net.

<P>] &gt;   1. poorly written applications that do send()-send()-receive()

] &gt;       instead of writev()-receive().
<BR>
] &gt;   2. applications that necessarily do send()-send() of small blocks.
<BR>
] &gt;   3. applications that send blocks larger than 1 MSS but not a multiple
<BR>
] &gt;       of the MSS on systems that do not block based on send() requests.
<BR>
] &gt; 
<BR>
] &gt; As far as I can see, only #3 might benefit from the proposal.  #1 and #2
<BR>
] &gt; would still be forced to set TCP_NODELAY.
<BR>
<P>] Even #3 might not benefit under some cases.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
quite true.
<BR>
<P>]                                             An example is associated with the
<BR>
] idiosyncrasies of the way application data is copied into mbufs in BSD based
<BR>
] systems. Data is copied in 4K or 1K chunks (whichever is larger) unless
<BR>
] the data is less than 1K when it is copied as a whole. Suppose the application
<BR>
] tries to write 1600 bytes of data (assuming 1MSS = 1500 bytes). Then the 
<BR>
] mbuf layer would make TCP send 1K first, and the remaining 576 bytes would
<BR>
] be held according to the Nagle's algorithm (even under the new proposal).
<BR>
<P>(nits:  what's an mbuf layer?--&quot;layer&quot; seems a tad fancy for sosend().
<BR>
And MSS=1500 is a lot less common than MSS=1460, the still minority
<BR>
MSS=1452, or the uncommon MSS=1444.)
<BR>
<P>Wouldn't you consider a TCP implementation that divided the stream into
<BR>
segments based on mbuf partitioning fundamentally broken?--I would.
<BR>
I'd sneer at any TCP implementation that sends an initial 1K segment
<BR>
given a send() request and an MSS both significantly larger than 1K,
<BR>
no matter what its excuse (well, other than window space).
<BR>
Consider the retransmissions from such an implementation.
<BR>
<P>I also don't see how tcp_output() in 4.4BSD-Lite would do such evil deeds.
<BR>
Given mbufs payloads of 1K and 576 or any other combination, it seems to
<BR>
me that len = min(so-&gt;so_snd.sb_cc, win) - off.
<BR>
<P>Finally, as I understand the proposal, while the classic Nagle algorithm
<BR>
would delay the a remainder of 100 (MSS=1500) or 140 (MSS=1460), the
<BR>
proposed algorithm would not.  It would immediately send the remainder.
<BR>
That is exactly the case for which it has been proposed.
<BR>
<P>] Due to the above, applications still might keep using TCP_NODELAY even if
<BR>
] the underlying TCP implements the proposed mod to Nagle's algorithm.
<BR>
<P>That conclusion is certainly true, but I don't agree with the example.
