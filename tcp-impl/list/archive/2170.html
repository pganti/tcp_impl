<P>
I can see your point; and have no difficulty seeing you saved a pass over the data
<BR>
for all but the first fragment, quite clever really, but it would make life harder
<BR>
for those that believe layering can be ignored completely when handling data that
<BR>
has been put on the wire ( and I think those in that school are crazy).
<BR>
<P>I however are in  the enforce layering absolutely school; and I  used objects when
<BR>
doing my stack. The tcp ( and all other protocols) checksums are done by calling
<BR>
the protocol object, so the call has to be done after you have filled in the
<BR>
destination and before you fragment.  The concept of fragmentation is unknown to
<BR>
the protocol object and it definitely doesn't get involved on putting the data on
<BR>
the wire.
<BR>
<P>Mind you; just as I believe defragmentation belongs in the NIC, I believe
<BR>
fragmentation belongs there also. This is possible if you treat the destination as
<BR>
something the protocol layer can get with a call to the routing layer ( which you
<BR>
have to do anyway as the destination address at least has to remain stable even if
<BR>
the destination has multiple NICs and the path changes), and you do the protocol
<BR>
checksum calculation in the protocol layer.
<BR>
<P>I however can see this is not how most people see the world. If the NIC deals with
<BR>
fragmentation and defragmentation. then there is no penalty if you use 64k ip
<BR>
packets, in fact things go better as you only have to deal with one header for
<BR>
every 64k in the main CPU. If there is no penalty why would you spend anytime
<BR>
working out the optimum packet size for the initial path.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; number is the last pkt sent in a family (same ip_id)

<EM>&gt; We don't reorder fragments we send packets in an optimised fashion.

<EM>&gt; Im suprised nobody else is doing this. Its common sense for any end host
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has to support software tcp checksumming
