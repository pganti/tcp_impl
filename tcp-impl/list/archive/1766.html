<P><EM>&gt;   *&gt; Yes, it *should* be a problem.  If your host can handle 78K p/s, then it
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am not sure I believe in the significance of this reasoning.  VJ TCP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deliberately chose an approach (e.g., ACK clocking) that gives great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robustness and adaptability to a wide range of speeds and delays, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not being strictly optimum in any particular circumstance.  Personally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe this is still the right approach; optimization has a cost and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is likely to limit robustness and adaptability, and the latter are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more important.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was not advocating or opposing changes to ACK clocking.  I was talking
<BR>
about the cases that I think Sam was talking about.  In those cases, ACK
<BR>
clocking is a bad thing, as are most of the other the TCP improvements
<BR>
including slow start.  When you are going full blast over a local network,
<BR>
you have not hit the wall on raw medium speed, and you are dealing with
<BR>
small packets (now &lt;=4 KBytes), then your hosts are limited (to a good
<BR>
first approximation) by their raw packet per second rates.  To predict
<BR>
your best throughput on media faster than your CPU's, multiply your p/s
<BR>
rate by 60% of your MSS, or to predict your maximum p/s rate, divide your
<BR>
throughput by 0.6 of your MSS. 
<BR>
<P>I think the 30% of packets that are Acks does far worse to TCP throughput
<BR>
than merely make it not strictly optimum.  That factor of 0.6 in the formula
<BR>
*hurts*.  I also don't have any wonderful ideas for reducing the number
<BR>
of Acks only when it would not be naughty.

<P>] ...
<BR>
] It will always be more computation than processing less ACKs.
<BR>
] However, it should be possible to have a network interface
<BR>
] where incoming interrupts are suppressed for a time (maybe
<BR>
] for all packets, maybe for solo ACKs, ???), such that the
<BR>
] source scans the input as part of its packet output routine.
<BR>
<P>] I.e., the normal 'inner loop' could be:
<BR>
] 	send a packet
<BR>
] 	process an ACK
<BR>
]
<BR>
] (or one every other, etc).
<BR>
]
<BR>
] This would cut the number of input packet interrupts. 
<BR>
<P><P>For more than 10 years, Sam's employer has been shipping systems that do
<BR>
more sophisticated kinds of &quot;interrupt rate limiting,&quot; &quot;interrupt
<BR>
throttling,&quot; &quot;interrupt merging,&quot; or &quot;interrupt bursting&quot; than that loop,
<BR>
using timers, counters, and other stuff in hardware, software, and
<BR>
firmware.  Other UNIX vendors have also been in that market for a long
<BR>
time.  My experience was that TCP goes fastest at about 0.1
<BR>
interrupts/packet.  Fewer interrupts/packet allow the inevitable,
<BR>
occassional miss in the game of patty-cake among hardware, board software,
<BR>
and host software to take so long to be recovered by an interrupt that
<BR>
throughput starts to decline.  If your ratio of CPU cycle rate to medium
<BR>
bit rate is more than 10X from 1:1, I suspect that rule of thumb would
<BR>
break down, and you'd want more or less than 0.1 interrupts/packet.
<BR>
<P>Some media, notably FDDI if you build the hardware right, enforce such
<BR>
interrupt rate limiting.  Once you grab the token and start transmitting,
<BR>
you cannot get any input or input interrupts.  The half-duplex nature of
<BR>
a token ring caused bursts of ACKs to arrive at 20+ Kp/s.  Today FDDI is
<BR>
slow, but 10 years ago you had to work very hard (and foolishly) to have
<BR>
as many as one host interrupt per Ack.
<BR>
<P>Because of the way the BSD IP input queue and tcp_output() work, if your
<BR>
host has cycles to spare while running at 100% of the medium, then
<BR>
something like the loop described above is exactly what you get, just as
<BR>
at slow speed over WANs.  That is the whole point of Ack clocking.  On
<BR>
the other hand, when the limit is CPU cycles, I doubt it is good to have
<BR>
the interrupt service routine doing a lot of fiddling with windows and
<BR>
sequence numbers that will be duplicated by tcp_input() and tcp_output().
<BR>
At 78 Kp/s, you have only 13 usec for absolutely everything you are going
<BR>
to do with a packet.  Even at 500 MHz, and even if you reduce interrupts,
<BR>
that's not a lot of cycles.
<BR>
<P>Many people have proposed various things, such as TCP agglomeration
<BR>
(segment assembly) in firmware or hardware, but there are almost always
<BR>
good reasons to not implement them.
<BR>
<P><P>] I would claim that processing ACKs at this rate is part
<BR>
] of the price of playing nice, allowing the source to 
<BR>
] avoid bursts. If you want to negotiate around it for
<BR>
] sources that can pace, that's even better. But the 
<BR>
] default can be 'play nice'.
<BR>
<P>It seems hard to figure out how to reduce the number of ACKs on a fast
<BR>
LAN without being naughty in other important cases, which is why none of
<BR>
the UNIX vendors (as far as I know) have shipped anything that doesn't
<BR>
always play nice by default, even when it would help a lot (1/0.6) to cheat.
