<P>
<EM>&gt; I would ask of anybody who is planning on attending the BOF and who has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific TCP implementation problem to discuss, that they bring it up, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advance, on this mailing list.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  In putting together the BOF we discussed the issue of identifying
<BR>
specific flaws.  We recognize that it is crucial that TCP implementors find
<BR>
the working group (if one is formed) useful and not hostile.  Implementors
<BR>
understandably don't want problems blown out of proportion, particularly
<BR>
ones that have already been fixed.  On the other hand, people inevitably
<BR>
want to know which TCP's exhibit which sorts of behavior, as this can save
<BR>
immense amounts of work in trying to debug networking problems.
<BR>
<P>I think the key distinction is between implementor &quot;bashing&quot; and implementor
<BR>
&quot;naming&quot;.  It will be vital for those participating in the working group
<BR>
to recognize that TCP implementation is very tricky - that's the whole reason
<BR>
why the BOF is valuable - and that the goal is to assist the process of
<BR>
improving the state of the art.  Related to this, it seems like one of the
<BR>
likely products of the working group will be a catalog of known implementation
<BR>
problems.  I would argue that this catalog should include implementation
<BR>
details, as well as notes discussing fixes in later or pending releases.
<BR>
<P>The agenda has me kicking off the BOF with a &quot;motivation&quot; presentation.
<BR>
I haven't put this together yet, but here's a sketch of some of the
<BR>
implementation problems I intend to talk about.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vern
<BR>
<P><P>- The Comer/Lin study on probing TCP implementations.  As I recall, the main
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation problems they found regard zero-window probes in SunOS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.0.3 and Solaris 2.1.  I don't know the status of whether these have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been fixed (I would certainly guess they have), if someone knows, please
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;let me know.  I may omit this because it's now fairly dated, or maybe I'll
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;talk about it later in the BOF as one approach for identifying flaws.
<BR>
<P>- The Brakmo/Peterson study on problems in 4.4 BSD.  They found medium-serious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;header prediction and fast retransmit bugs, and suboptimal RTO estimation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not specific to a particular vendor, though many implementations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are derived from 4.4 BSD.
<BR>
<P>- A recent study by Dawson, Jahanian, and Mitton (of eecs.umich.edu), not yet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;published, on testing TCP implementations using a &quot;fault injection tool&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's available from
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~sdawson">http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~sdawson</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;They look at SunOS 4.1.3, AIX 3.2.3, NeXT Mach, Solaris 2.3, OS/2, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 95 TCP implementations, finding a number of flaws.  I haven't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;read the paper yet.
<BR>
<P>- Findings from a large-scale TCP dynamics study I'm close to finishing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These have not yet been published.  The ones I plan to talk about are:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Windows 3.1 with the Trumpet/Winsock 2.0B TCP stack doesn't do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow start, and discards any packets that arrive above a sequence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hole, forcing go-back-N retransmission.  It also sometimes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generates only one ack for a large number of packets.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Linux 1.1 retransmits the entire unacknowledged window on loss
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than just the first unacknowledged packet.  Alan Cox tells
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me this has been fixed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Solaris 2.3 and 2.4 can time out prematurely if the RTT is fairly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large (since fixed).  Solaris 2.3 sometimes only acks if the segment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has PSH set or if the delayed ack timer expires.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A bug leading to slow start being skipped by a number of Reno-derived
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations if the remote TCP doesn't send an MSS option in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its SYN ack.
<BR>
<P>Some minor problems I may talk about if there's time:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Some Reno implementations are inconsistent about whether they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include the length of TCP options in determining the maximum segment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size (Matt Mathis discussed this in the past, along with how to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fix it).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Solaris 2.3 does not recognize FIN's set on packets received out
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sequence.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Windows NT 4.0 with the Microsoft TCP stack does not do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast retransmit.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The duplicate-ack counter in HP/UX 9.0 is not cleared on a timeout.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In HP/UX 9.0 and 10.0, after a timeout subsequent dup acks (rare)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advance the congestion window if the timeout was for a packet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previously sent using fast retransmission.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- SunOS omits generating dup acks for packets received above a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sequence hole.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Solaris 2.3 and 2.4 have a bug in the fast recovery code so they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't send packets when they could.
