<EM>&gt; &gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Another thing we need to add to the list of tcp issues appears to be properly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; handling of MTU discovery in the presence of no ICMP. The number of big name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; web sites demonstrating a total lack of clues in configuring their firewall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and hosts (block ICMP, mtu discovery on) - big names too - suggests we must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make correct behaviour in the presence of failure of mtu discovery a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SHOULD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you figure is the right response when an HTTP client sends a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few redundant ACKs and then a FIN?   Isn't that what your &quot;big name&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server with MTU discovery on and ICMP blocked will see?   How is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different from many other problems, starting with transient unidirectional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blackholes (e.g. routing problems) and continuing with data-dependent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packet loss?
</EM><BR>
<P>The lack of getting back an ICMP message when a packet is dropped
<BR>
due to it needing to be fragmented and DF being set is what I have
<BR>
always refered to as &quot;black hole detection&quot;.  There used to be routers
<BR>
that could disable the generation of all ICMP host unreachable messages
<BR>
to protect old 4.2BSD based hosts, but they went too far, breaking
<BR>
PMTU Discovery.  RFC 1435 was written to address that issue.  An
<BR>
over-agressive firewall that blocks ICMP provides a situation that
<BR>
is indistinguishable from the routers that didn't generate the ICMP
<BR>
message.
<BR>
<P>I've not implemented black hole detection (in part, because if the
<BR>
routers adhere to RFC 1435, you shouldn't need it), but one method
<BR>
is fairly straight forward, even if it is a bit painful.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) You keep track of connections that have retransmissions.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) After a set number of retransmissions, you decide to turn
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the black hole detection.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Black hole detection assumes that the packets are being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost due to the DF being set and the ICMP message being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blocked.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Go to your internal table of MTUs, and drop the connection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down to the next item.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Go back to step 2
<BR>
<P>You could also just turn off DF after a certain number of
<BR>
retransmissions, and keep retransmitting.  If you then get
<BR>
an ACK, assume that we've detected a black hole.  Turn back
<BR>
on the DF, and drop down to the next smaller size in the MTU
<BR>
table.
<BR>
<P>But in any case, its all based on heuristics of making assumtions
<BR>
about the lack of response from the remote host, and we can all come
<BR>
up with situations where this type of heuristic would fail.  Hopefully
<BR>
failure would just mean sending smaller than optimal data packets.
<BR>
<P>One could also keep track of the largest packet that has ever been
<BR>
sent and received, and only do the black hole detection when sending
<BR>
a packet larger than that value.  Of course, a change in the path
<BR>
could cause that kind of decision to be inaccurate.
<BR>
<P>I never followed through on implementing Black Hole Detection
<BR>
because it didn't seem to me that the hassels of developing the
<BR>
code was worth the payback.
