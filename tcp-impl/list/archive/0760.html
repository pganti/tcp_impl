<P>
<EM>&gt; Presumably this means that ssthresh should be reset when congestion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occurs.
</EM><BR>
<P>More exactly, when TCP responds to a loss, by either a timeout retransmission
<BR>
or beginning a fast retransmit/fast recovery sequence, it first sets ssthresh
<BR>
based on the value of cwnd in effect at the time of the loss.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have observed (ina simulation) that if congestion occurs then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple segments tend to be lost or timeout, cwnd is set to MSS after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first loss ...
</EM><BR>
<P>For a timeout retransmission, this is correct behavior.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... and hence ssthresh is set to 2*MSS.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is incorrect.  ssthresh is supposed to be set *first*, to half of the
<BR>
current value of cwnd.  This happens before cwnd is set to 1 MSS to begin
<BR>
slow start.
<BR>
<P>If cwnd was sufficiently large to begin with, then the only normal circumstance
<BR>
in which ssthresh should be set to 2*MSS is if the retransmitted packet is
<BR>
itself lost (or if the slow start following the retransmission doesn't get
<BR>
very far before there's a loss).  In that case, ssthresh (again) gets set
<BR>
to half of cwnd, which gets rounded up to the minimum value of 2*MSS if
<BR>
needed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thus, I take this mean that ssthresh should be reset to half the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window size when congestion occurs, but should not be reset until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congestion goes away ...
</EM><BR>
<P>There's no explicit notion of congestion going away.  The algorithm is
<BR>
that ssthresh is always set to cwnd/2 (modulo rounding) when a fast
<BR>
retransmission begins or a timeout retransmission occurs.  If you have a
<BR>
timeout retransmission that is itself lost, then yes, ssthresh is set to
<BR>
MSS*2 - and that's what you want, because the net is still congested, so
<BR>
you must proceed gingerly.
<BR>
<P>I've noted this as an area to clarify as we tweak RFC 2001.
