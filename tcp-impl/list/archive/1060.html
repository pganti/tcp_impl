TCPIMPL Minutes
41st IETF -- Los Angeles, CA
March 30, 1998
<P>Minutes reported by Mark Allman and Vern Paxson.
<P><P>1.  Testing Tools I-D
<P>    Last call for the I-D found two problems.  Vern outlined the modifications
    required before forwarding the I-D to the IESG.  A section on
    the ns network simulator will be added to the draft.  Also, a
    better security section is needed.  The security considerations
    that will be included are:
<P>	* Tools could be used to create rogue packets and/or denial
          of service attacks
        * Some tools require root access to run
        * Some tools require bringing foreign code into kernel
        * None of the tools evaluate security
        * In order to run some tools, you may compromise the
          security of your system by running untrustworthy code
        * Some tools require watching traffic, which can raise
          privacy and security concerns 
<P>2.  Known Problems I-D
<P>    Vern noted the changes to the Known Problems I-D since the last
    meeting.  These changes included a few general clarifications
    and a new section on the ``Failure to RST on close with data
    pending''. 
<P>3.  Pending Problems
<P>    The problems that have not yet been documented in the known
    problems I-D have been classified as either serious,
    not-so-serious or security related.  The goal behind the
    classification is to do triage on where our efforts should
    go in order to finalize the known-problems I-D.
<P>    The proposed serious problems were: 
<P>	* Initial RTO too low
	* CWND uninitialized
	* Failure of window deflation due to header prediction
	* Retransmission sends 2 packets
	* First-hop PMTU Discovery
	* MTU Black Holes
	* RTO fails to back off
<P>    It was noted that first-hop PMTU discovery should
    not be special-cased, as it is a general path problem.  Matt Mathis
    wondered if the MTU black hole is a bug or a research question.
    He further noted that MTU discovery should be done without ICMP
    due to security concerns (and, noted that this might fall under
    ``security problems'' rather than ``serious problems'').  Matt
    suggested that we note the problem and state that we do not yet
    know how to solve it.  Ran Atkinson suggested that MTU
    discovery is not a security problem as a host must be
    continuously jammed with ``too small'' ICMP messages for an
    attack to be successful.  Matt suggested advocating that the
    IESG re-open PMTU Discovery as broken.
<P>    The less serious problems were then outlined:
<P>	* Failure to set PSH when send buffer drains
	* Failure of window deflation due to fencepost error
	* Failure to ACK above-sequence data
	* Incorrectly setting ssthresh after a retransmission is
          lost 
	* Incrementing cwnd too aggressively during congestion
          avoidance
<P>    It was pointed out that cwnd can stop growing when the window
    becomes too large using the standard algorithm during congestion
    avoidance and that this should be documented.  Vern asked
    whether this has been observed in practice, and the answer
    was Yes.
    
    The proposed security problems were:
<P>	* Predictable initial sequence number
	* Ameliorating SYN flooding
	* The Land attack
	* Forged RSTs
	* Forged ICMP unreachables
<P>    Ran noted that forged unreachables is an IP problem not a TCP
    problem.  Furthermore, he suggested that if we are planning to
    deal with unreachables we should also document forged
    redirects.  Vern begged for volunteers to write up security
    problems.
<P>4.  Re-starting idle connections
    
    Amy Hughes presented an overview of mechanisms that can be used
    to prevent large line-rate bursts following an idle period
    during a TCP connection.  Amy outlined three ways to detect
    bursts: 
<P>	1.  Receive Timer (if connection has not received a segment 
	    within the last RTO).
	2.  Send Timer (if the connection has not sent a segment
	    within the last RTO)
	3.  Packet Counting (if the number of segments to be sent is
	    larger than a given threshold)
<P>    Also, four methods of ``burst recovery'' were outlined:
<P>	1.  Full restart (reset cwnd to 1 segment)
	2.  Window limiting (cwnd = outstanding + 1 segment (or
	    initial value))
	3.  Burst limitation (cwnd unchanged; send X segments now)
	4.  Pacing (cwnd unchanged; send X segments now and schedule
	    a timer for the next transmission of X segments)
<P>    Finally, four possible solutions were presented:
<P>	1.  Current Method -- Jacobson &amp; Karels
	    Send or receive timer with full restart.
	2.  Congestion Window Monitoring -- Hughes, Touch &amp;
	    Heidemann
	    Packet counting with window limiting
	3.  Maxburst Limitation -- Floyd
	    Packet counting with burst limiting
	4.  Rate Based Pacing -- Visweswaraiah &amp; Heidemann
	    Send timer or packet counting with pacing
<P>    It was also noted in the presentation that bursting situations
    other than those that can follow idle TCP connections are
    handled by congestion window monitoring (CWM), maxburst
    limitations and rate based pacing, but not by the timer
    solution.
<P>    A discussion of the mechanisms followed.  Some of the comments
    voiced: 
<P>	* Raj Jain noted that bursts may be preferable to clamping
          the congestion window with CWM in long-delay networks.  
	* Mark Allman noted that while losing cwnd on long-delay
          networks hurts performance, loss also hurts performance so
          it may be preferable to limit bursts in an attempt to
          limit loss.
	* Vern asked if people thought that implementing timers in
          TCP was still considered a ``big deal''.  It was noted
          that comparing timestamps is not a big deal, but if a new
          code path and additional resources are needed a new timer
          may be objectionable.  Bill Simpson noted that timers are
          fine unless they expire (for instance the delayed ACK
          timer is OK, but a pacing timer is not).  Bill argued that
          we should be focusing on making TCP work well in
          ``common'' environments and not tweaking TCP so that a
          single satellite connection runs well in satellite
          networks.  Vern noted that the number one goal for TCP is
          stability not performance.
	* Sally Floyd noted that maxburst limitation and CWM are
          very different mechanisms (one closes cwnd and the other
          does not).  She noted that the studying the impact of
          these mechanisms is still a research issue.
	* Vern stated that it would be nice if there was a solution
          that worked well across all environments.
	* Tim Shepard noted that a single TCP can congest a network
          and therefore congestion control mechanisms are important
          to even a single TCP connection across a satellite network.
	* Sally clarified maxburst as sending K segments in response
          to a single ACK.
	* Matt Mathis noted another cause of bursting is the
          scheduler on high speed workstations.
	* Tim Shepard asked what we were trying to decide.  Vern
          responded that we are trying to decide the proper behavior
          of TCP connections after an idle period for the revision
          of RFC 2001.
	* Tim stated that he likes CWM as it is more conservative
          than maxburst.  But, he thinks it is still research
          issue. 
	* Spencer Dawkins noted that wireless links look worse than
          normal links and that a burst limiting mechanism is
          important to those environments.
	* Scott Lawrence wondered if applications will attempt to
          not let TCP connections go idle.
	* Sally noted that maxburst was not designed for use after
          an idle timeout, but may be appropriate for that use.  She
          noted that research is needed in decaying the size of cwnd
          over the idle period.
<P>5.  ns' new network emulation capabilities 
          
    Kevin Fall presented an overview of ns and ns-2's network
    emulation capabilities that are currently being researched.
    Kevin's slides are available at: 
	<A HREF="http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/kfall/tcpimpl98.ppt">http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/kfall/tcpimpl98.ppt</A>
<P>6.  Increasing the initial window size
<P>    Sally presented a short overview of the proposal to increase
    TCP's initial window size.  Vern re-iterated the consensus of
    the last TCPIMPL meeting: That rough consensus was generated for
    an initial window of 2 segments and that 3 and 4 segment initial
    windows would be accepted at this meeting unless new evidence is
    shown or a convincing argument was made.  A discussion
    followed.  Below are some of the major points:
<P>	* A question about whether this mechanism has been studied
          in low bandwidth links was raised.  Tim gave a brief
          overview of his dialup link simulations (a formal
          presentation was given at the 40th IETF meeting).  Bill
          Simpson stated that he didn't believe the simulations or
          think the proposal is a good idea.  He was particularly
	  concerned with small Web transactions that would not
	  suffer loss using an initial window of 1 but would with
	  an initial window of 4.
	* Matt suggested that TCP constants (like the initial window
          size) appear in the assigned numbers document.  Vern
          argued that making these constants undergo a full review,
          as the current proposal has, makes changing the numbers
          harder and therefore less likely to be done in haste.
	* A suggestion was given that if you know you are connected
          to a gateway with only a few buffers the host should
          simply advertise a small window.  Bill stated that he
          thought this was a bad idea because of the problem
	  of deploying such a tweak among a large installed base.
	* It was noted that using compressed HTML a larger initial
          window may not be needed (or used).
<P>    Vern called for a show of hands and it was determined that rough
    consensus exists for larger initial windows per the proposal.
