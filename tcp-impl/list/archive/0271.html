<EM>&gt;Actually, 3 key parameters, as already written in RFC-813:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Should not be less than the time the application takes to process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the data (&quot;holding&quot; or &quot;processing&quot; time).  When RTT dominated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    processing time (low delay networks), need floor (&quot;minimum value&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see anything in the discussion of the holding time that
<BR>
implies a minimum value for the ACK timeout (ATO). The discussion talks
<BR>
about a minimum value on the RTT calculated at the sender to prevent
<BR>
spurious retransmission due to the fact that the receiver is delaying an ACK.
<BR>
We see this problem in Linux due to the fact that we use 10 milisecond
<BR>
or 1 milisecond granularity timers (depending on the hardware).
<BR>
If we don't place a 200 millisecond floor on the RTT then we do
<BR>
spurious retransmission against BSD derived stacks which have a fixed 200
<BR>
millisecond delayed ACK policy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    No floor specified, but the example is 200 to 300 milliseconds.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    always thought of that as a floor of 200 and a ceiling of 300.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only place I find these numbers mentioned in the RFC is on the
<BR>
discussion of the expected interarrival time on the Arpanet.
<BR>
Have I missed something?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Should not be more than measured 1/2 RTT, as otherwise might cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    retransmission.  RFC-1122 specifies a ceiling of 500 milliseconds.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't find any discussion specific to this point in the RFC.
<BR>
What have I missed?
<BR>
<P>As to the 500 millisecond ceiling, this seems to derive from the
<BR>
500 millisecond granularity in the RTT calculation on BSD derived stacks.
<BR>
Since we always have a 500 millisecond &quot;over estimate&quot; (roughly
<BR>
speaking) in the RTT a 500 millisecond ceiling on the delay prevents
<BR>
a spurious retransmission due to a delayed ack. Also note that
<BR>
if you are calculating the RTT with higher resolution timers you
<BR>
need to consider this fact. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) Should be related to inter-arrival time of packet _bursts_ (back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    back packets).  This was for _high_ delay &quot;very slow&quot; links, trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to measure how long it takes a packet to transmit down the slowest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    link.  Unfortunately, a packet train over ethernet/FDDI/OC-3 will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    have virtually zero inter-arrival time, while a 1500 byte packet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    at 9600 bps is 1.5 seconds.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we filter the ATO measure we do against large changes in the
<BR>
interarrival time for just this reason. As you observe the 500 millisecond
<BR>
ceiling kicks in on really slow links, and on really fast links
<BR>
we end up just ACKing every second packet as required by RFC-1122.
<BR>
(Although I can still measure the ATO on 10 base-T ethernet, it's
<BR>
just very small. I'm not so sure about 100 base-T or FDDI, maybe
<BR>
when we have 1 millisecond clocks.  Also, at this speed delay between
<BR>
packets might be dominated by the time the sending machine takes to
<BR>
stuff the next packet into the network and not on the transmission
<BR>
delay in the network.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    BTW, this was for future research, in the appendix.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite right. Perhaps this discussion is straying from the charter
<BR>
of this group at this point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As I mentioned, I used &quot;srtt/2 + mdev&quot; quite successfully, with a floor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of 100 ms and a ceiling of 500 ms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Note that you on a pure receiving link you have no RTT measure.
<BR>
If you use the initial srtt and mdev settings on your link you are
<BR>
essentially setting the ATO to a constant on a pure receiver.
<BR>
