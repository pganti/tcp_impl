||Name of problem: Failure to retain above-sequence data
<BR>
||
<BR>
||Category: Congestion control, performance
<BR>
||
<BR>
||Description:
<BR>
||        When a TCP receives an &quot;above sequence&quot; segment, meaning one with a
<BR>
||        sequence number exceeding RCV.NXT but below RCV.NXT+RCV.WND, it
<BR>
||        SHOULD queue the segment for later delivery (RFC 1122, 4.2.2.20).
<BR>
||        A TCP that fails to do so is said to exhibit &quot;Failure to retain
<BR>
||        above-sequence data&quot;.
<BR>
||
<BR>
||        It may sometimes be appropriate for a TCP to discard above-sequence
<BR>
||        data to reclaim memory.  If they do so only rarely, then we would
<BR>
||        not consider them to exhibit this problem.  Instead, the particular
<BR>
||        concern is with TCPs that always discard above-sequence data.
<BR>
||
<BR>
Comment from the old PC/TCP for DOS days.  In a limited memory
<BR>
environment such as DOS in days gone by, and very possibly
<BR>
in various network computers, handheld widgets, etc. in  days to
<BR>
come, a stack has to balence very carefully network behavior with
<BR>
system behavior.
<BR>
<P>The old DOS stack was bound by limitations of memory that caused its
<BR>
default buffer management to have 3-5 MTU sized packets and 10-20
<BR>
NFS RPC sized packets.  That &lt;10K memory chunk was all that could
<BR>
be taken from the system environment without affecting system behavior
<BR>
and performance in other ways.
<BR>
<P>Our old out of sequence policy was to retain 1 and only one out of sequence
<BR>
packet provided the SN of that packet was not more than 1 MTU above the
<BR>
last received &amp; ack'ed packet.  Combined with a carefully selected receive
<BR>
window of not more than 3*MTU this policy balanced system memory,
<BR>
window size and lost packets reasonably well.  However, if you upped
<BR>
the window size to higher multiples of the MTU - say 5*MTU or 8K all
<BR>
bets were off.
<BR>
<P>Our algorithm worked because the window size was controlled to reflect the
<BR>
out of sequence retention policy. It seems to me that modifying your
<BR>
2nd para. in the SHOULD above slightly to indicate that in cases where 
<BR>
a TCP host is memory limited - that a combination of window size 
<BR>
management and limited out of sequence retention can be used to 
<BR>
balance memory usage and network behavior.
<BR>
<P>While its easy to dismiss our old DOS memory issues as obselete, the
<BR>
underlying issues of low memory TCP implementations will undoubtably
<BR>
resurface from time to time as TCP is pushed onto smaller and cheaper
<BR>
devices.
<BR>
<P>L.
