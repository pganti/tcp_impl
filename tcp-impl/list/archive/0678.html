<P>
<EM>&gt; Does slow-start after idle adjust the RTO at all (say, start timer backoff)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Good question.  My leaning is no - I'd expect that RTO remains a decent
<BR>
estimate for quite a while, and it would be nice to avoid the possible
<BR>
performance hit that would come from resetting it to the startup value.
<BR>
I discussed this with Van and this is his thinking on it too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've seen a large percentage of TCP retries on private networks with a TCP 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application that each send short, infrequent exchanges of data. I have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hunch part of the problem is this stale RTT estimate.
</EM><BR>
<P>You see them needlessly retransmitting?  If so, some traces would resolve
<BR>
whether they're doing so because the RTO was too stale, or whether for some
<BR>
other reason.
