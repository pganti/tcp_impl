<EM>&gt; Well, I'm glad you didn't ban them, because I've run into a situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where they are essential.
</EM><BR>
<P>A question of definitions, surely :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At a certain company whom I'll call XYZ, there is a firewall box that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; among other things, maintains state for every TCP connection that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open through it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is relevant because the firewall box has a timeout on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; per-connection state.  A connection idle for longer than that timeout
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have its firewall state dropped, and thereafter its packets won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get through when it de-idles.  Keepalives fix this.  (You don't want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know how long it took me to figure out what was killing my connections.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously such a firewall is not expected to interoperate with
<BR>
all specification-compliant uses of the TCP; some parts of BBN
<BR>
are behind such a firewall -- when it was installed, people
<BR>
stuck behind were able to get the vendor to produce a modification
<BR>
such that the timeout was increased to something on the order of days.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What's the opinion of the list here?  If keepalives are to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; condemned, it seems to me we will also have to condemn anything else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which causes an idle connection to be destroyed, such as a stateful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; router that drops packets for which it has no state (if nothing else,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the box could crash).
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps such routers should in fact be condemned. Or at least,
<BR>
encouraged to use sensible state aging policies (i.e. age the state
<BR>
when there is too much of it, not after an arbitrary period).
<BR>
