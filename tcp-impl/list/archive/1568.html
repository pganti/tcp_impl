<EM>&gt; Just for an exercise, suppose TCP does not delay an ack for a segment smaller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than MSS size if the segment received prior to that is a full MSS size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segment.  It still uses the current delay ack strategy for full MSS size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segments.  Will this solve the problem we are discussing when combined with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Nagle modification on a per-send basis?
</EM><BR>
<P>Would a PTMU smaller than the MSS interfere with the receiver's ability
<BR>
to tell a full-sized segment from a small one? Especially in a
<BR>
unidirectional case, or an assymetric route case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This should be easy to implement, much easier than an adaptive delay ack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithm.  Will Vernon consider this as a bloat to OS?  Are those extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acks in some situations acceptable to people on this list?  Note that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just an exercise on thinking what delay ack strategy should be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it is my belief that &quot;today&quot; an ACK costs just as many CPU cycles
<BR>
as a data segment.
