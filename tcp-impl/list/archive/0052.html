<EM>&gt; I don't quite follow some of the details here:

<P>My apologies for not being clear enough.  The scenario to which
<BR>
I was referring  was a client TCP that does not support RFC1122
<BR>
half duplex close with RST (it is a SHOULD, not a MUST).  This
<BR>
causes the server process to hang if the client closes the connection
<BR>
with traffic in the pipe.  Maybe it only happens for your second
<BR>
scenario: if the server blocks on a write() when a send window of data
<BR>
is unacknowledged;  if there is enough data to send then the send
<BR>
window will go down to zero - presumably this ends up blocking the
<BR>
write.  I don't know if the average web page contains enough data
<BR>
to trigger flow control from the receiving application back to the
<BR>
sender.
<BR>
<P>I think the sequence of events is as follows:
<BR>
<P>1.  server  is blocked on write()
<BR>
2.  client closes normally and server ACKs (client in FIN-WAIT-2
<BR>
and server in CLOSE-WAIT).  No RST because RFC1122 is not followed.
<BR>
3.  server never closes
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; To get round this, Netscape (but not all web browsers) sets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SO_LINGER to zero, i.e. the application forces the RST.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But this would only send out a single RST, which might get lost. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens if the RST is lost and the server retransmits? Aren't we now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back in the same situation described in the first paragraph, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presumably can lead to hung servers too, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>But the client has closed, so any data received will be RST because
<BR>
there is no socket, isn't that the case?
<BR>
<P>It's a small point maybe, but it's another bug that should be listed
<BR>
(and a clarification of the TCP specification).
<BR>
<P>I forgot to mention that multiple concurrent TCP connections exacerbates
<BR>
the situation, as might be expected.
