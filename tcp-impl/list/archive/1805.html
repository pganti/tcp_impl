<EM>&gt; From: Vern Paxson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vern@ee.lbl.gov?Subject=Re:%20TCP's%20handling%20of%20IP%20precedence&In-Reply-To=&lt;199909151357.HAA19174@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">vern@ee.lbl.gov</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would agree with Allyn that this sets a terrible precedent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In the past, whenever change to TCP was proposed, the answer has been that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there are millions of existing TCP instances out there so we could not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; change it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sorry to say it, but the time to have voiced concerns over this change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was during the IETF Last Call on the diffserv documents.  It is too late now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to rescind the fact that the diffserv architecture allows for modification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the TOS byte in flight.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you think about it for a momenet, that reasoning is obviously incorrect.
<BR>
It assumes that everyone is required to read all IETF documents.  Since
<BR>
getting anything changed during Last Call is at best difficult, it requires
<BR>
that everyone participate in all working groups.  It also assumes that no
<BR>
recent standards track document is ever wrong or ever needs significant
<BR>
revision.  It assumes that DiffServ is more special and unchangable than
<BR>
TCP as defined in RFC 793, which can be freely changed, despite the fact
<BR>
that there are far more RFC 793 implementations and installations than
<BR>
RFC 2474.  It provides a procedure for a small part of the IETF to make
<BR>
arbitrary changes to protocols that most of the IETF cares about, simply
<BR>
publish an RFC, sneak it through Last Call, and then make the claim of
<BR>
fait accompli.
<BR>
<P>However, all of that observed, I'm not sure this problem requires 
<BR>
major changes to TCP or DiffServ.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; We just sent in the I-D on the proposed change to TCP.  When it pops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out, I'll send a note to tcp-impl (not end2end-interest, since I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this change is more closely related to TCP implementation) and we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue discussion there.  (That said, those wanting an advance peek can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fetch a copy from <A HREF="http://www.aciri.org/vern/draft-xiao-tcp-prec-00.txt">http://www.aciri.org/vern/draft-xiao-tcp-prec-00.txt</A>.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Instead of requiring changes to an unknown but apparently significant
<BR>
number of existing TCP implementations and literally uncountable TCP
<BR>
installations, why not strengthen the DiffServ words about upward
<BR>
compatibility?  If the RFC 1349/RFC 1812 values of the IP TOS byte were
<BR>
required to be get through unchanged (after possibly having been mapped
<BR>
to other values and back again), would any existing combinations of
<BR>
applications and host break?  For example, if the most common value, 0,
<BR>
were required to be handed to the receiver if 0 were sent by the sender,
<BR>
wouldn't things be a lot healthier?
<BR>
