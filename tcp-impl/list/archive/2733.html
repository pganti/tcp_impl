Hello- <br><br>
Are you currently looking for a new job opportunity right now with a
engineering team delivering leading edge storage products? Or maybe you
know someone who is?&nbsp; <br><br>
I have several clients, located in Silicon Valley, who are looking for
experienced Embedded System Engineers.&nbsp; Some of these clients are
pre-IPO in stealth mode, while others are well-established Storage
Networking companies.&nbsp; <br><br>
The ideal candidates would have strong architectural skills, as well as a
solid background in file system and storage orientation.&nbsp; Embedded
systems experience, design/implementation of network protocols, as well
as experience in SCSI or Fibre Channel would be a large bonus.<br><br>
If this sounds like a fit for you, then send me your resume and let me
know what your current situation is. If this doesn't sound like a fit for
you, but maybe you know someone else who might be looking, please forward
my information along.<br><br>
Thank you so much for your time!<br><br>
Regards,<br>
