<P>
Kathie,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have raised a number of questions, some of which I answer
<BR>
below, but you have not covered the question of general interest which
<BR>
addressed the differences in performances of Reno and Tahoe in
<BR>
asymmetric networks.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Subir,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Have you actually observed the problems mentioned in this paper in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cable data systems? 
</EM><BR>
<P>As you point out this paper assumes a rather poorly designed system, I
<BR>
suspect the authors did so to make their analysis easier. Our system has
<BR>
been designed for large deployments taking real world constraints into
<BR>
account, and includes a number of optimizations that help to mitigate
<BR>
these kind of problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I took a look at that paper and there seem to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be some assumptions made about the underlying MAC that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a poor design. Lakshman et al state that a solution is to control 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access to the upstream link. Com21's systems do this and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainly possibly within the MCNS spec. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The Hybrid system also controls access to the upstream link. It should
<BR>
be clear from reading the paper that any vendor who does not do so will
<BR>
have a poorly performing system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It seems like most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buffer overflow problems could be solved with sufficiently large buffers.
</EM><BR>
<P>If this was always the case, then there would be no need for congestion
<BR>
control at all ;-). There is no way to avoid buffer overflows in real
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The asymmetry problem appears somewhat overblown, too, as the downstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bandwidth is the limiter for two-way cable modems and the telco return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is only return limited if there's no sharing of the downstream. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Our studies show that the downstream is the limiting factor in both type
<BR>
of systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Admittedly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are still a lot of unknowns about cable data system performance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but we haven't seen this sort of thing in detailed simulations or in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;packet traces on our systems. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This depends on how extensive these tests have been.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd be inclined to try to get the MAC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;designed right before trying to change the implementation of a protocol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that runs on a lot more kinds of systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still think that the problem pointed out in the paper is a real one.
<BR>
It is true that the authors have over simplified the system so that it
<BR>
can be conveniently analyzed, but this is a common technique among
<BR>
academics. The problem may not occur if there are only a few users in
<BR>
the system, but as soon as there are a sufficiently large number of
<BR>
users, buffer shortages will occur, and TCP congestion control will kick
<BR>
in. I would also like to re-focus the discussion on the congestion
<BR>
control scheme, rather than specific vendor implementations.
