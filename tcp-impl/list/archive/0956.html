<EM>&gt;&gt; I would rather see the &quot;receiving TCP&quot; open the window when it detects

<EM>&gt;&gt; this case and resetting the connection if any new data was received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Opening the window has a semantic implication that does not apply if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data is simply dumped.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. But not opening the window isn't very productive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The only other option that may make sense to discuss is whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;receiving TCP&quot; just resets the connection when there is data on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; receive queue when the application &quot;closes&quot; the socket (in such a way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that it can no longer read that data). I don't a strong opinion on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; whether this is better (we could argue that it isn't because most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; implementations open the window and reset if more data is received).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think that this approach would be better because it does not give the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mistaken impression that data has been given to the application.
</EM><BR>
<P>This does have that attraction - one end of the connection would be told
<BR>
that something is wrong because of the reset.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I still wonder though if this is not really an application issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a stack issue since the TCP stack does have to deal with this. If
<BR>
it doesn't handle this correctly, the connection can remain in the hung
<BR>
state forever - certainly, the sender application can start a timer and
<BR>
give up if that timer expires, but that is not robust since the receiver
<BR>
application may be blocked from processing for a &quot;long&quot; time and the
<BR>
sender can't tell the difference.
