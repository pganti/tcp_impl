<EM>&gt; From: Art Shelest &lt;<A HREF="mailto:artshel@microsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20internet%20draft%20on%20suggested%20mod%20to%20the%20Nagle%20algorithm&In-Reply-To=&lt;199902051806.LAA20288@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">artshel@microsoft.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why not parametrize the Nagle?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead of &quot;allow only one unacknowledged segment&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow &quot;allow N unacknowledged segments/bytes&quot; and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specify recommended range of values.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The N=2 would be similar to current proposal and also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fix the case where application follows the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;small write, small write, read&quot; operation, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is not addressed by the proposed draft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The N=2 seems like a good choice, because receivers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typically ACK every other packet.
</EM><BR>
<P>How would you implement that?  You could record not merely the sequence
<BR>
numbers of RFC 793 and the one additional sequence number of the draft,
<BR>
but the starting sequence number of each of the last M segments, where M
<BR>
is the maximum value of your N.  You'd probably want to record the sequence
<BR>
numbers corresponding to the starts of application write requests instead
<BR>
of segments on the wire.  On each write, you'd just cycle the stack of
<BR>
previous sequence numbers.  For likely values of M, you wouldn't need more
<BR>
than a couple 100 bytes for every TCB, and they could be maintained and
<BR>
used with only a few 100 instructions at start, another few 100
<BR>
instructions on every send.  However, we're not talking about typical
<BR>
GUI bloatware, where adding cycles to every keystroke does not matter.
<BR>
TCP/IP can now be done with a few dozen cycles total, so adding such
<BR>
overhead would not be good.  I don't see how to implement a parameterize
<BR>
Nagle algorithm in real life.
<BR>
<P>I am unhappy about the English descriptions of the current and modified
<BR>
Nagle algorithms in the draft.  As I read it, the English description of
<BR>
the modified Nagle algorithm is only slightly related to the later concrete
<BR>
description.  Like talk of a parameterized Nagle scheme, the English in
<BR>
the draft sounds nice until you try to figure out what it might really
<BR>
mean, and then you realize it is at best fuzzy.  That is a Bad Thing(tm).
<BR>
To fix this problem, I would delete the English description of the modified
<BR>
algorithm and stick to the concrete talk of sequence numbers.
