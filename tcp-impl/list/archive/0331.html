<EM>&gt; &gt;A high RTT requires a high window size to avoid pipeline stalls. It sounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like you are talking more about some of the cases SACK handles. SACK I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is beyond this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A high RTO may be due to long queue in a slow link.  For example, a student
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dials in to school from home to access school's web pages.  The link is low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latency (~5ms) and low bandwidth (maybe 14.4Kbps).  And the RTO can get to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high value because of long queue, in turn because of large window, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dial in server.  I guess the list may not be interested in this situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it does not affect the Internet at large.  But I think if TCP uses a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good estimate of the bandwidth delay product as the window size instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an arbitrary big window, the problem will be solved for this case and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cases like high latency low bandwidth...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I am waiting to see SACK to be widely deployed...

<P>At (14.4 kbps / 8 b/B) * 0.005 sec, you get about 9KB/sec through the
<BR>
pipe.  One 552 byte packet takes 50 msec.  If you keep 8 in flight
<BR>
(buffer size of 4KB) you get a 400 msec delay.  If you try to keep
<BR>
32KB in flight, either you get a long delay or at some point the queue
<BR>
overflows.  If your queue holds the whole 32KB, you get a long delay
<BR>
but no loss and TCP goes as fast as it possibly can (exactly link
<BR>
speed).  If you take an isolated loss and your sender implements fast
<BR>
retransmit and fast recovery correctly, you halve the amount of
<BR>
packets in flight from the point of loss.  If you take multiple
<BR>
losses, you can have the window size more than once and also end up
<BR>
with a timeout.  That is where the fix to fast recovery is needed.
<BR>
<P>The fix, proposed by Sally Floyd in the appendix of one of her papers,
<BR>
is to remain in fast recovery until the ACK progression has advanced
<BR>
all the way to the last packet transmitted when the dupplicate ACKs
<BR>
where noticed.  Luigi Rizzo has implemented this for FreeBSD TCP in
<BR>
his SACK and TSACK code.  Luigi gives credit to J. Hoe but doesn't
<BR>
give a reference, so maybe it was independently discovered.  See the
<BR>
description of Newreno at <A HREF="http://www.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/sack.html">http://www.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/sack.html</A>.
<BR>
<P>The scope of this WG is to identify errors in implementing TCP.  I'm
<BR>
not sure what error if any you are suggesting the WG document since
<BR>
TCP makes no estimate of the delay-bandwidth product other than
<BR>
backing off when a loss occurs.  If you think it should, then that is
<BR>
a matter for the research community who would be happy to review a
<BR>
well thought out proposal to fix TCP when you have one.
<BR>
<P>The sort of fix for fast recovery described above might be slightly
<BR>
out of scope for this WG since it is just emerging from the research
<BR>
community in BSD TCPs.  Or it might not be.  Vern?
<BR>
<P>Curtis
<BR>
<P>ps- If you are having the problems with a particular host on the
<BR>
sender end, there is a good chance it doesn't do fast retransmit
<BR>
and/or it retransmits more than it has to after the drop occurs.
<BR>
These are implemention errors already documented by this WG.
