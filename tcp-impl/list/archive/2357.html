<EM>&gt; From: stanislav shalunov &lt;<A HREF="mailto:shalunov@internet2.edu?Subject=Re:%20Calculations%20of%20ISN%20for%20new%20TCP%20sessions&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009191945.e8JJjg415323@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">shalunov@internet2.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My point is that you have to assume that the attacker *knows* exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; how you're generating the ISNs; all you can keep secret (except in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; short term I mentioned), is the entropy you've accumulated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh.  What I meant is that there would be no practical way for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacker to distinguish between the output of PRNG and true random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source, if given two files: one with true random numbers and the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with PRNG output.
</EM><BR>
<P>As der Mouse said, that distinction is meaningless in this context.  You
<BR>
must assume that the attacker has a current copy of the source to your
<BR>
TCP code and local hardware for private experiments.  For decades, current
<BR>
commercial TCP source has been spread widely in universities and big
<BR>
customers.  Non-disclosure agreements are sufficient to protect trade
<BR>
secrets and useless against anyone guessing ISN's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree with that.  I only *responded* to (obviously incorrect, or at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least very carelessly worded) cryptographic claims.  An earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message by another author contained assertion that packet arrival
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times contain 5 or 6 bits of entropy (which seems over-optimistic to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me) and that &quot;[e]ven [...] those 5 or 6 bits are valuable&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I made that claim.  What is my &quot;(obviously incorrect, or
<BR>
at least very carelessly worded) cryptographic claim&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course, they're valuable.  They give one much more entropy than one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could ever possibly want for a very good PRNG.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is an obviously incorrect, or at least very carelessly worded
<BR>
cryptographic claim.  Even the best crypto PRNG can be trivially and
<BR>
extremely quickly reversed if you know all but 5 or 6 of its initial state.
<BR>
In this context, you must assume the bad guy knows which of the 5 or 6
<BR>
input bits are variable, because the bad guy has a copy of your source.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;                                                 (I would prefer a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pessimistic estimate of the amount of entropy in packet arrival times,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as 0.01 bits per packet, but even that's more than enough.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Your 0.01 bits/packet of entropy makes no sense to me.  If there were only
<BR>
0.01 or even 1 bit of entropy in packet arrival times, then we wouldn't
<BR>
need RTP and the many other ToS and QoS mechanisms.  Even the telco guys
<BR>
would have switched to packets 25 years ago.
<BR>
<P>Consider the 10 MHz Ethernet packets I was talking about.  They won't come
<BR>
more often than once every 64 microsecond slot time.  Their nanosecond
<BR>
arrival times within slot times will depend on the clocks of their senders
<BR>
and of any bridges and Ethernet repeaters in their paths, as well as many
<BR>
sources of hardware noise (e.g DRAM refresh, bus contention, interrupt
<BR>
latency, DMA state machine latency) in the senders, bridges, repeaters,
<BR>
and receiver.  Their nanosecond arrival times will have more than 8 bits
<BR>
of entropy.  Add the effects of other traffic on the Ethernet (including
<BR>
the SYN-ACK), that the average packet size on most LANs is 8 or more slot
<BR>
times instead of 1, and you clearly have 15 or 16 bits of entropy per
<BR>
packet with nanosecond clocks and 5 or 6 with microsecond clocks.
<BR>
<P>Then, since ISN attacks on LANs are silly, there is the entropy of packets
<BR>
arriving from wide area networks, which have another several bits of
<BR>
entropy, because their jitter is as much as 10's or 100's of milliseconds.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The actual &quot;how to do it&quot; is, of course, off-topic for tcp-impl.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can &quot;how to do it&quot;, getting entropy and using it to generate ISN's
<BR>
be off-topic for the IETF's TCP implemenetor's list?
