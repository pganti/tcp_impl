<P>
William,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:kennethw@VNET.IBM.COM?Subject=Re:%20Proposed%20TCP%20Group%20Extensions&In-Reply-To=&lt;199706211509.IAA23527@sgi.sgi.com&gt;">kennethw@VNET.IBM.COM</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Andy Capella and would like to submit to this working group an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; internet-draft defining groups of objects to extend those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; objects defined by RFC2012.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Wrong Working Group.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; We would prefer that this is done via a standard MIB as oppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to Enterprise Specific MIB definition to enable interoperable Management
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Application support. The following are the groups of objects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that we would define by function:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Is there an interest in this type of submission?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Count me as strongly opposed.  One of the objectives of the TCP MIB was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to narrow the list to be as small as possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>The TCP-MIB in RFC2012 has 19 objects where the first four:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpRtoAlgorthim
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpRtoMin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpRtoMax
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpMaxConn
<BR>
<P>all allow an entity to see the configuration of a TCP. There are also
<BR>
10 global counters. All 14 of these objects are simple objects.
<BR>
The first part of the proposal consists of add 3 to 4 simple objects
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpKeepAliveTimer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpReceiveBufferSize
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpSendBufferSize
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpRestrictLowPorts
<BR>
<P>(tcpRestrictLowPorts may not be needed) to enhance configuration. I also
<BR>
believe that all of the configuration objects should be defined as
<BR>
read-write capable and not read-only to enable remote configuration. The
<BR>
amount of storage that this adds isn't an issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Recent messages to this list talked about keeping small TCBs for Syn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attacks. Have you counted the number of bytes you just proposed adding?
</EM><BR>
<P>The TCP Connection Table contains 5 objects of which the first four
<BR>
are its indexes. The second part of the proposal attempted to
<BR>
define a small set of objects that could be added:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnLastActivity
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnBytesIn
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnBytesOut
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnReXmt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnRoundTripTime
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tcpConnRoundTripVariance
<BR>
<P>I claim that except for BytesIn and BytesOut that TCP needs
<BR>
to keep these values any way so that the actual storage increase is
<BR>
8 OCTETs per connection which isn't that significant compared to
<BR>
the total.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The general rule for MIBs is:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Never add a variable unless more than 50% of the management stations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   will need to view it on a regular basis!
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that you mean this as an absolute since almost none
<BR>
of the transport MIB work (AToMMIB for example) work would be useful
<BR>
since I doubt that 50% or more of the current Management platforms
<BR>
are doing ATM Management. I think that this needs to be considered
<BR>
from the function being managed.
<BR>
<P>Adding a few objects to enhance configuration and added a hand full
<BR>
of objects to the TCP Connection table is the core of the proposal.
<BR>
I was never adamant that the TCP state information be included which
<BR>
was why they were listed as optional. I had thought that possibly
<BR>
a few of them should be included with the non-optional group
<BR>
and that by listing them all I could get that type of feedback.
<BR>
<P>Given that the TCP Connection Table exists and that it does allow
<BR>
a SET to tcpConnState the TCP Group also adds the capability to
<BR>
manage connections.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nota Bene: It is not SNMonitoringP.  SNMP is about MANAGING networks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not debugging platforms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Regards, Ken
<BR>
