<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; By sending a RST instead of the FIN to abort the connection, we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cause both the server side and client side stacks to tear the connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; down immediately, and avoid the half-close where it gets caught.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All this does is (unreliably) kludge around a bug in the transport
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stack. There is no guarantee that RST will ever make it to the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (witness all the connections that get waylaid in FIN_WAIT_2...) And
</EM><BR>
Yes, but its a much greater chance than zero, which is what happens now.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The most common manifestation of the problem on the server side is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that web server admins find that over time, their server threads or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; processes become hung.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the server's stack is not dropping the connection to RTX exhaustion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is a bug in the server stack. If it is indeed dropping the
</EM><BR>
No.  It the client window is full, the window probes will continue
<BR>
forever. 
<BR>
I think this statement is true:
<BR>
There will be no retransmit.  There cant be a retransmit if the window
<BR>
is closed.
<BR>
<P>In Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated, page 325:
<BR>
&quot;The characteristic of the persist state that is different from the 
<BR>
retransmission timout in Chapter 21 is that TCP 'never' gives up sending
<BR>
window probes.  These window probes will continue to be sent at 60 sec 
<BR>
intervals until the window opens up or either of the applications
<BR>
using the connection is terminated.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I need to check if the bad stack is responding, at all, to the
<BR>
probes, and to find out:
<BR>
what happens to TCP if the probes are simply unacknowledged?
<BR>
<P>Ill get back on these issues.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; connection, then the admins are simply being too impatient. We are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely talking several minutes here.
</EM><BR>
No, it appears to be forever.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So we should compound the problem by committing a second wrong? (liberal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of abortive close)
</EM><BR>
Well, this is a tough issue.  if a connection is to be aborted, the
<BR>
only way to have the server discard data it wants to send, the only
<BR>
way appears to be via RST.  Yes, I know, this is the intent of the 
<BR>
half-close.  Unfortunately in HTTP, 'aborted connections' are so common.
<BR>
On top of which, HTTP seems to thwart almost every optimization in TCP
<BR>
altogether.
<BR>
<P>An idea I have bounced around is to suggest prohibiting the half-close in HTTP.
<BR>
By this I mean that before every write, you must check the read 
<BR>
status of the socket for EOF, and abort if so. 
<BR>
( makes half-close a full close )
<BR>
Dont flame me on that, Im still looking into what kind of sense it
<BR>
makes, if any.
