<P><EM>&gt;            ....   I understand that it's probably too late to change the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DiffServ spec now, but perhaps we can learn something from this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>If it is not too late to change RFC 793, then how can it be too late to
<BR>
change RFC 2474?  Does the fact that RFC 793 is about 10 times older
<BR>
and at least 10,000,000 times more widely implemented really mean that
<BR>
RFC 2474 is the one that cannot be changed?   SHEESH!
<BR>
<P>Let's agree that there is a problem, and set out to solve it with the
<BR>
minimum overall pain, but with the onus for bearing most of any unavoidable
<BR>
pain on DiffServ.

<P>] ...
<BR>
] Seems to me that the 'failure' is a TCP-based application believing
<BR>
] it is operating over a path that uses Precedence values e2e to
<BR>
] provide service differentiation, when in fact the path does not.
<BR>
<P>That confuses the new notion of DiffServ with the old TOS definition. 
<BR>
Under the old rules, it was perfectly reasonable for some routers in the
<BR>
path to pay attention to the TOS bits while other routers ignored them.
<BR>
<P><P>] There are also three 'solutions' that dont require TCP mods:
<BR>
]
<BR>
] 	- Apps dont get smart - leave precedence as 000, and DS
<BR>
] 	  regions default to re-mapping the lower 3 bits
<BR>
] 	  of the DSCP to 000 on egress.
<BR>
<P>That solution is impossible, because there are already &quot;smart,&quot;
<BR>
very widely deployed applications.  Please note again what you will
<BR>
find if you search the nearest BSD source tree for &quot;TOS_&quot;
<BR>
<P>That solution also does not help purely dumb applications whose TCP
<BR>
connections break because newfangled DiffServe routers in the path don't
<BR>
all agree on how to map 0x00, and the path varies as a result of dynamic
<BR>
routing.
<BR>
<P><P>] 	- Apps that want to be 'smart' take their chances.
<BR>
<P>That also doesn't help those dumb applications whose TCP connections
<BR>
break.  
<BR>
<P>It also seems unfair to smart applications that have been deployed in
<BR>
the last seven (7) years to use TOS queuing as suggested by RFC 1349.
<BR>
<P><P>] 	- Apps request 'precedence bits' that happen to be the same
<BR>
] 	  as lower 3 bits of the DSCP the DS region will assign on
<BR>
] 	  ingress.
<BR>
]
<BR>
] Although the third option begs some obvious questions, all in
<BR>
] all it might be easier to start with the above 'usage rules' than
<BR>
] to insist all TCP stacks are upgraded.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure I understand what is meant by that.  The talk of PHB's and
<BR>
router TOS bits in RFC 2474 also makes little sense to me.  The words in
<BR>
RFC 2474 about mapping TOS values seems to be based on the obviously false
<BR>
notion that only 0 and the &quot;router&quot; TOS values were ever used.
<BR>
<P>If you mean something that includes the idea that 0x00, 0x10, and 0x08
<BR>
would be somehow carried unchange from host to host (but with possible
<BR>
intermediate changes to other values), then that's what I've been trying
<BR>
to say.
<BR>
<P><P>] There is also the ugly fourth option:
<BR>
]
<BR>
] 	- If a DS region sees packets arriving with non-zero
<BR>
] 	  precedence values, the packets are tunneled to the
<BR>
] 	  likely egress from the DS region, with only the outer
<BR>
] 	  header having its TOS/DS field twiddled.
<BR>
<P>Let's not, if only because that doesn't help dumb applications using
<BR>
0 whose TCP connections are broken when 0 is mapped to non-0.
