<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Some that I could think of are:

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;- No listener (for a SYN segment)

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;- Receiver discard connection (data received on a connection with no higher

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;level receiver available)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;- Application abort (application requested RST on connection instead of

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;closing it)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I'm sure that your reasons are well-meant and quite honest, but I have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; wonder out loud if these codes won't be of great help to a hacker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Only if they're trying to hack your statistics or debugging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think (pls correct me if this is not the case) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone is proposing different receiver actions based on these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;codes; it's just for diagnoses, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Any information shot back to the sender of a SYN is potential information
<BR>
for a hacker. For example, if the code says something like &quot;too busy&quot; (or
<BR>
something that might indicate that), then Joe Hacker knows that your server
<BR>
is on the brink: just keep pumping SYNs until it keels over. If it says
<BR>
something like &quot;bad security&quot; or &quot;bad precedence&quot;, well, you are just asking
<BR>
for it. :-)
<BR>
<P>On typical servers, a new incoming connection usually implies that a daemon
<BR>
will be spawn or something like that, in other words, resources will be consumed.
<BR>
If that malicious person can get a view into how you are denying his SYN attack,
<BR>
he might be able to tune the attack and kill your server/router/etc.
<BR>
<P>All I say is &quot;let's be careful&quot;. The less information you provide back to the
<BR>
potentially malicious instigator, the lesser the chances that it will know how
<BR>
to affect you worst.
<BR>
<P>In fact, I would almost argue that an RST in response to a SYN or SYN/ACK should
<BR>
not contain any information whatsoever (unless a kernel flag was turned on) to
<BR>
minimize this potential. I have no problem with info on RSTs which are sent
<BR>
elsewhere in the cycle, ie, from established onwards.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; I also hope that all those vendors mentioned have knobs to enable these codes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; only when desired (they should default to disabled).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That seems like it would make diagnoses harder; if they're just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;informational, they could default to 'on'.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I'm saying is that you only want to turn them on when you are actively
<BR>
debugging something. Until then, leave them off. There is no need to provide
<BR>
extra tools to the intruders out there.
<BR>

<BR>
&quot;Just because I'm paranoid it doesn't mean they are not after me&quot; :-)
