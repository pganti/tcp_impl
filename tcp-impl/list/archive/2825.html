<P>IP TELEPHONY
<BR>
<P>By: MsC. Judith Vivar Mesa

<BR>
<P>Seven years have happened since the first softwares appeared to support conversations PC to PC, almost like a game for the users of the computer networks. In this time much is what has been advanced both in the field of the standards and in the production of the equipment that allows to do telephonic call, telephone to telephone, across the IP networks.
<BR>
<P>The traditional market of the telecommunications is influenced by new operators who compete with the public traditional operators of telecommunications both in networks and in services, among which there are included Internet Services Providers (ISPs), Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSP), which constitute a suppliers' new class of services that are constructing his global IP networks. On the market of the IP Telephony are included private networks or intranets, WAN/extranets and companies transporters as IXCs (InterExchange Carriers), among which they are outlined AT&amp;T, MCI, Spring; Deustche Telecom and others.Also there have proliferated small national and international operators who offer an alternative to big operators for calls in these segments, which are known as Competitive Access Providers (CAP), regional telephonic operators companies or Regional Bell Operating Cias (RBOCS), as well as commercial and business clients who have grown greatly in metropolitan re!
<BR>
gions, but that for its connection need of other network operators these are so called Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). Besides, the manufacturers of equipments for Internet must be included in this world, as well as developers of applications for World Wide Web.
<BR>
<P>Many are the aspects that appear as advantages of this new way of establishing the telephonic calls.
<BR>
Much is what still stays in the countries for regulating for the utilization of this service.
<BR>
<P>The certain thing is that the telephony IP is already a reality and that income is predicted big for the transporters and big savings for the companies that use them in spite of the fact that the topic of the quality of service continues being a white hot topic.
<BR>
<P>Within the framework of event, our specialists will have the opportunity to give their vision and to discuss on the different aspects from IP telephony as they are:  Protocols used, regulatory frame, new services, VoIP and the services of intelligent network, quality of services, how to make a project of VoIP, etc.
