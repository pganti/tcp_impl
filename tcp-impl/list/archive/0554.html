<EM>&gt; CC: vjs (Vernon Schryver)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   One way might be to have an ICMP or TCP option that requests the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other end to provide a response, giving the size of the largest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fragment received. This would be enclosed in the SA that the TCP data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is flowing in. This is in some sense a variation of the TCP MSS option.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is this &quot;other end&quot;?
<BR>
If talking to the other end of a TCP connection were enough, then the
<BR>
MSS negotiation would be enough and the Path MTU Discovery mechanism
<BR>
would not be needed.  In fact, the MSS negotiation is often not enough
<BR>
because a vast number of boxes between the ends might legitimately tell
<BR>
you to reduce your MTU.  The boxes in the path vary, as routes change.
<BR>
Not only might every router that might sometimes be in the path need to
<BR>
send a reduce-MTU indication of some kind, but so might bridges (e.g
<BR>
FDDI-Ethernet bridges that necessarily IP fragment, honor the DF bit,
<BR>
and send the ICMP message.)
<BR>
<P>The trouble with authenticating path MTU information (regardless of its
<BR>
form) is key distribution.  How would you get the right key to all of
<BR>
the boxes that might be in the path so that you could trust them?
<BR>
Given the implications for the security of the keys in sending them to
<BR>
every router in the net that might touch youyr packets, who would want
<BR>
to?  You can't just determine that a box is who it says it is.  After
<BR>
you authenticate box99.bad.guy.com as the sender of the ICMP error
<BR>
message telling you to use an MTU of 68, what do you do?
<BR>
<P>The only response to worries about path MTU messages, as well as source
<BR>
quences, port, net, and host Unreachables, and many other such
<BR>
indications is to be to cross your fingers and ignore any that would
<BR>
have serious consequences, such as an message telling you to use an MTU
<BR>
of 68.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I can't think of many cases in the current deployed internet where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the MTU might change during a connection. Usually, the smallest MTU is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the edges at that 28.8 (or that 2400 baud modem) link, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't likely to change suddendly. I can see mobileip possibly changing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this. If/when mobileip is deployed en-mass, it will definitely include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IPsec.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a vast amount of topology on the edges, what with ATM (9180),
<BR>
FDDI (4352), Ethernet (1500 or 1492), PPP (256 to more than 1500), and
<BR>
Frame Relay.
<BR>
<P>Besides, if you stay away from the edges and in the center where routes
<BR>
don't flap among links with different MTU's, you may as well fix your
<BR>
MTU=1500 and forget Path MTU discover.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   Getting Path MTU information back to the sending TCP is not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsurmountable challenge to VPN uses of IPsec, but it isn't easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, I think the key distribution problem is insurmountable
<BR>
and makes authenticated path MTU information impossible.  For example,
<BR>
look at any real life network and see how many FDDI-EThernet bridges
<BR>
there are that have not been given a IP address (manually or by bootp
<BR>
or DHCP) and so cannot send the ICMP message when the drop an packet
<BR>
with the DF bit set.  If people cannot manage to set their IP addresses
<BR>
(thus wrecking not only MTU discovery but SNMP), how can you expect
<BR>
them to do something useful about keys?
<BR>
