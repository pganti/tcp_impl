Included message from <A HREF="mailto:mrosu@us.ibm.com?Subject=Re:%20Counting%20ACKs%20in%20NewReno&In-Reply-To=&lt;199903160844.AAA21819@jurassic.eng.sun.com&gt;">mrosu@us.ibm.com</A>:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First, let me clarify my proposal: upon receiving a partial or full ack, dupacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decremented by (the number of segments acknowledged - 1), i.e.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dupacks -= #segs_acked -1.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oops, I misunderstood yours as
<BR>
<P>dup_ack_cnt = dup_ack_cnt - segs_acked - 1.
<BR>
<P>Now, I see where that - 1 comes from.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A segment is retransmitted if dupacks is &gt;= 3. The duplicate acks don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to ack the previous segment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me try another example.  Using your notation, cwnd = 5,
<BR>
<P>[1] 2 [3] 4 5
<BR>
<P>After fast retransmitting seg 1, partial ack for seg 2 comes back.  Then
<BR>
dup_ack_cnt -= 2 - 1 = 2.  (I hope I get it right this time (-:)  So
<BR>
using your idea, since dup_ack_cnt &lt; 3, seg 3 will not be retransmitted.
<BR>
cwnd is set to 5 - 2 + 1 = 3.  So no new segment can be sent.  TCP has
<BR>
to time out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I didn't say that 2 is not a good idea. What I'm saying is that within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the window, counting dupacks more carefully will get you about the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;results as the old algorithm but with less risk. Furthermore, as you advance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beyond the right edge of the window, the new algorithm preserves &quot;hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to collect info&quot; (# of dupacks) and having this info helps you avoid timeouts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when segments immediately to the right of the window are lost.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we can separate your modification into 2 cases.  Using NewReno's
<BR>
terms, partial ack and ack covers recover.  Firstly, I don't believe that it
<BR>
is &quot;risky&quot; at all in retransmitting the first unack'ed segment after getting
<BR>
a partial ack.  Fast retransmit is triggered because of 3 dup acks.  We
<BR>
assume that there is no reordering, thus the segment is really dropped.  This
<BR>
means that no partial ack or complete ack can be sent back until this
<BR>
dropped segment is retransmitted and received by the receiver.  Thus
<BR>
retransmitting a segment because of a partial ack is as &quot;risky&quot; as the first
<BR>
fast retransmission.  They are all linked together.
<BR>
<P>Suppose for the moment, we just apply half of your idea, do the dup_ack_cnt
<BR>
calculation but relax the dup_ack_cnt &gt;= 3 rule.  If after leaving fast
<BR>
retransmit phase, dup_ack_cnt is still &gt; 0, can we infer that some of the
<BR>
new segments sent during fast retransmit phase are also dropped?  I'll say
<BR>
probably.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Due to my limited experience, I can't agree or disagree with you. I thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that timeouts and unnecessary retransmissions are always bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the network is very congested, what is not good for a connection can be
<BR>
the best way to prevent network collapse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't see the benefit of clearing the dupacks counter. Please elaborate.
</EM><BR>
<P>The dup_ack_cnt is just an implementation detail in NewReno which is used to
<BR>
identify when fast retransmit start and ends.  Reseting it to 0 just means
<BR>
it is the end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When there are no losses, the dupacks counter will go to zero rapidly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Because of lost acks, there will be attempts to decrement the counter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;below zero. Anyway, dupacks should always be &gt;= 0.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No. The congestion window should be handled as in the current draft.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, my intention is to ask when you stop the fast retransmit phase.
<BR>
Do you stop only when dup_ack_cnt becomes 0 or a time out happens?  The
<BR>
reason I ask is that a fast retransmit phase covers a single congestion
<BR>
event.  If cwnd is adjusted as in the draft, the loss of a new segment sent
<BR>
during fast retransmit phase is treated as the same congestion event.  I'd
<BR>
suggest cwnd needs to be decremented when recovering for segments sent
<BR>
beyond recover.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm not sure idea 2 is always safe. For instance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consider an initial window of 5, with segments 1 and 5 lost:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[1] 2 3 4 [5].
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How safe is to retransmit 5 upon receiving a partial ack for 4?
</EM><BR>
<P>As I described above, it is as &quot;safe&quot; as the first fast retransmission
<BR>
of seg 1, especially in this example.
