<P>
I would like make wndshift the negotiation more aggressive.  The
<BR>
current socket buffer size (set by SO_RCVBUF) is not the best
<BR>
control to choose the wndshift to negotiate.
<BR>
<P>The current approach creates problems if the server side of an
<BR>
application does not have sufficient advance information on a plausible
<BR>
range for cwnd or the receivers window.  To get the winshift negotiation
<BR>
correct but not consume excessive mbufs (on many systems) it is
<BR>
necessary to set SO_RCVBUF very large before the listen, and then
<BR>
adjust both SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF to more realistic values once the
<BR>
client is known.
<BR>
<P>No stock applications do this correctly, and it is a royal pain to
<BR>
retrofit..... (&quot;more realistic values&quot; has its own set of research
<BR>
questions.)
<BR>
<P>It would be better if the negotiation defaulted to attempting the
<BR>
wndshift necessary to support the system wide sb_max.  (Yes there
<BR>
should also be a way for applications to override it).  Then the
<BR>
application can later adjust SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF up or down as it
<BR>
sees fit.
<BR>
<P>This will be fatal to any dinosaurs that croak on winshift options.
<BR>
Does anybody know of any?   I suspect that there are enough people
<BR>
owning systems with the current behavior and default SO_RCVBUF &gt; 64k to
<BR>
have already persecuted the dinosaurs.
<BR>
<P>It also subjects all applications to window quantization.  Does
<BR>
anybody know of any applications that depend on controlling the sender
<BR>
through deliberately tiny windows?  (I suspect that these applications
<BR>
are non-functional anyhow, due to silly window avoidance.)
<BR>
<P>We are currently testing a kernel that uses sb_max to select the
<BR>
winshift to negotiate.
<BR>
<P>Comments?
