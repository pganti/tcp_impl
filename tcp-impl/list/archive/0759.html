<P>
RFC2001 states that:
<BR>
<P>&quot;When congestion occurs (indicated by a timeout or the reception of
<BR>
dupliucate ACKs), one-half of the currect window size should is saved in
<BR>
ssthresh.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Presumably this means that ssthresh should be reset when congestion
<BR>
occurs. I have observed (ina simulation) that if congestion occurs then
<BR>
multiple segments tend to be lost or timeout, cwnd is set to MSS after
<BR>
the first loss, and hence ssthresh is set to 2*MSS. This limits the
<BR>
total achievable throughput.
<BR>
<P><P>Thus, I take this mean that ssthresh should be reset to half the current
<BR>
window size when congestion occurs, but should not be reset until
<BR>
congestion goes away. Is this reasonable? If so, how to determine when
<BR>
congestion has gone away?
<BR>
<P><P>I'm sure this must have been discussed before. If so, any reference?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks in advance...
