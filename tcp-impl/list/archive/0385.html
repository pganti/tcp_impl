<P>
As for turning on the option only when (your equivalent to) sb_max
<BR>
is large--I think most of the time you'll find it desirable to 
<BR>
run systems with a large sb_max.  A system-wide switch on the scaling
<BR>
option is awfully coarse.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:braden@ISI.EDU?Subject=Re:%20%20Failure%20to%20send%20window%20scale%20option%20with%20shift.cnt%20==%200&In-Reply-To=&lt;199704301658.KAA17505@mica.denver.sgi.com&gt;">braden@ISI.EDU</A>
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe jt is correct; there have been no problems with SYN options.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not realize you received copies of all trouble reports sent to
<BR>
SGI's hotline, not to mention all bug reports in SGI's internal database.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   *&gt; I have some very clear memories of problems with systems that assumed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; window sizes cannot be larger than 32765, and I don't mean only boxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; running flavors of UNIX.  One was a fancy 'scope/logic analyzer that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; when crazy and sent one byte every couple of minutes in what looked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; like some kind of window probe.  Such experiences tend to make you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; conservative in what you send.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, and that is exactly why large windows can only be used if BOTH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sides indicate ability to deal with them.  Which is why a system that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understands large windows but does not want to enlarge its own window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should send a window option with zero.
</EM><BR>
<P>That makes sense only if you also agree that no systems fall over
<BR>
when they receive the TCP option itself.
<BR>
<P>As of about 1989, I do not agree with that premise.  I reserve
<BR>
judgement for 1997.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   *&gt; I changed SGI's default window size to 60K because it improved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; performance significantly in interesting cases, but is there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; significant harm to being conservative in sending the window shift
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; option?  Again, in how many applications does active-opener not set a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; large SO_RCVBUF but the passive opener wants to receive big windows?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; How many of those do not have the active-opener not set a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   *&gt; SO_SNDBUF?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not a popularity contest.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is true.  We are all adults and will make our own decisions on our
<BR>
on criteria and live with the consequences.  You are welcome to your
<BR>
opinions and also free to say whatever bad things you want about me. 
<BR>
I reserve the reciprocal priviledges.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;                                    But how about an FTP data connection?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It has data flowing only one way, so only the receiver needs to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the large window size.  The sender does not want to tie up receive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buffer space unnecessarily.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some systems do not &quot;tie up receive buffer space&quot; as the result of
<BR>
the application's SO_RCVBUF or SO_SNDBUF.  Some do not even have
<BR>
a meaningful sb_max, including some based on 4.*BSD socket code.
<BR>
<P>A file copy data connection might quite plausibly want to have a large
<BR>
SO_SNDBUF size to minimized context switches.  To repeat that point for
<BR>
at least the third time in different words, if you don't set SO_SNDBUF
<BR>
to more than 8K, you might not get very impressive ttcp or netperf
<BR>
numbers, even if your system is running at a very high clock rate.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;                              And some systems simply do not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough buffering capacity to allow a large window at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a red herring, since in those situations it is
<BR>
best to not use the scaling option at all in either direction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                                                            An
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assymmetry of window sizes seems quite natural, to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Assmetric window sizes do make sense.  That is one reason I repeatedly
<BR>
mentiond SO_SNDBUF.  Please note that &quot;SND&quot; is not the same string as
<BR>
&quot;RCV&quot;.
