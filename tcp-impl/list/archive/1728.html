As Vern mentioned yesterday, we have recently put together a paper
<BR>
that may be of interest to folks on this list.  The abstract and a
<BR>
pointer to the paper are attached below.  Please let us know if you
<BR>
have any comments!

Mark Allman, Vern Paxson.  On Estimating End-to-End Network Path
Properties.  ACM SIGCOMM, September 1999.  To appear. 
<P>The more information about current network conditions available to a
transport protocol, the more efficiently it can use the network to
transfer its data.  In networks such as the Internet, the transport
protocol must often form its own estimates of network properties
based on measurements performed by the connection endpoints.  We
consider two basic transport estimation problems: determining the
setting of the retransmission timer (RTO) for a reliable protocol,
and estimating the bandwidth available to a connection as it begins.
We look at both of these problems in the context of TCP, using a
large TCP measurement set [Pax97b] for trace-driven simulations.
For RTO estimation, we evaluate a number of different algorithms,
finding that the performance of the estimators is dominated by their
minimum values, and to a lesser extent, the timer granularity, while
being virtually unaffected by how often round-trip time measurements
are made or the settings of the parameters in the
exponentially-weighted moving average estimators commonly used.  For
bandwidth estimation, we explore techniques previously sketched in
the literature [Hoe96,AD98] and find that in practice they perform
less well than anticipated.  We then develop a receiver-side
algorithm that performs significantly better.
