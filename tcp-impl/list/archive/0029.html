<EM>&gt; &gt;    fast, few-packet exchanges (T/TCP)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    large, bulk transfers (TCP)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    character exchanges (Nagle optimizations)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    long, fat pipes (Large windows)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think all of them matter. Except for the words T/TCP. Thats for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experimental folk to play with not real systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  T/TCP has an RFC defining it, a book about it, and independent
<BR>
implementations.  That certainly seems to me to qualify it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The amount of character exchanges on the internet I would assume is dropping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot nowdays. Does anyone have good figures on percentages for the four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quoted categories ?
</EM><BR>
<P>There is tremendous diversity across sites in their traffic mixes, so you
<BR>
can't meaningfully talk about &quot;typical&quot; mixes except perhaps in the backbone.
<BR>
Both Web and FTP connections have heavy-tailed size distributions.  This means
<BR>
that you get a lot of &quot;fast, few-packet exchanges&quot; but that if what you care
<BR>
about is where all the bytes are coming from, they're due to a (very) few
<BR>
&quot;large, bulk transfers&quot;.  Regarding Joe's last item, certainly there are
<BR>
plenty of long pipes, and they do get fatter over time.
<BR>
<P>Finally, while character exchange isn't a heavy hitter in terms of bytes
<BR>
generated (it does a bit better in terms of packets generated), I wouldn't
<BR>
write it off.  For example, there were 2,600 telnet and rlogin connections
<BR>
into and out of LBL yesterday (we only have 2,200 employees).  Your site
<BR>
might look completely different - as noted above!
<BR>
