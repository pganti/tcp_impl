<EM>&gt;Given the following:

<P>the problem is that the receiver doesn't necessarily know that. It may know 
<BR>
that some packet previous in this session had been reordered, but it 
<BR>
generally has no visibility of other sessions on the same machine (which 
<BR>
may use different routes) or sessions to different machines. On the first 
<BR>
reordered packet in a session, it knows only that the message it has 
<BR>
received is not the next one it expected to receive. The discrepancy may be 
<BR>
due to reordering, and it may be due to loss. In the latter case, you'd 
<BR>
like to recover as quickly as you could.

<P><EM>&gt;       (maybe excet with SACK, i am a bit out-of-date on this)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wouldn't it make sense for the receiver who sees out-of-sequence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delivery of packets to withold the ACKs for such packets until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a) the hole is filled, or b) a small timeout has elapsed (this can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the same order of the delayed ack timer, or half the RTT if we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a local estimate available).
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe. An issue arises with delaying the Ack in the presence of a 
<BR>
measurement of RTT - the delay is itself part of the RTT. So I would argue 
<BR>
that only *these* Acks want to be delayed - only the Acks that might 
<BR>
trigger a retransmission. And when you do send them, it would be either to 
<BR>
acknowledge the now-in-order segment when it arrived and subsequently to 
<BR>
trigger further transmissions (would rather not see a burst) or to trigger 
<BR>
the retransmission, so in either case you actually want the specific Ack, 
<BR>
not a collected Ack of several segments.
<BR>
<P>I tend to think Sally's approach, being explicit rather than heuristic, is 
<BR>
a better one.
