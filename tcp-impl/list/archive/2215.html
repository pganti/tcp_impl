<P>
Okay, this time it is related to RFC 2581 (&quot;Reno&quot;) style fast retransmit
<BR>
recovery :-)).
<BR>
<P>Clearing of t_dupacks in FreeBSD/NetBSD:
<BR>
<P>Assume that we have started getting dup ACKs. We may or may not have
<BR>
done a fast retransmit and we may or may not be in fast recovery.
<BR>
t_dupacks is cleared in the following cases:
<BR>
<P>CASE 1: When a partial or a full ACK is received.
<BR>
CASE 2: On a retransmit timeout.
<BR>
CASE 3: Got a dup ACK [SEG.ACK == SND.UNA], but has a window update
<BR>
[SEG.WND != SND.WND]. 
<BR>
CASE 4: Dup ACK, but has data.
<BR>
CASE 5: SEG.ACK &lt; SND.UNA.
<BR>
<P>RFC 2581, page 6 says, &quot;The retransmit algorithm uses the arrival of 3
<BR>
duplicate ACKs (4 identical ACKs *without* the arrival of any other
<BR>
intervening packets) as an indication that a segment has been lost&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Interpreting the RFC strictly, CASES 3, 4 and 5 seem okay. However, it
<BR>
is not entirely clear why these cases have to reset t_dupacks. I can
<BR>
understand if t_dupacks doesn't get bumped up by such segments, but why
<BR>
clear it? Is there any specific reason for this or just plain paranoia?
<BR>
<P>The issue, however, is that this would cause grief during bidirectional
<BR>
data transfer (here we go again!). Between the time the first dup ACK
<BR>
comes in and a partial or full ACK is received, if CASE 3, 4, or 5 is
<BR>
encountered, we reset t_dupacks. Interestingly, CWND doesn't get
<BR>
deflated! There is a break statement which skips the CWND deflation in
<BR>
CASES 3,4 and 5.
<BR>
<P>The second confusion is related to Peterson and Brakmo's fix to the
<BR>
header prediction code to deflate the window. It is not clear to me what
<BR>
happens when t_dupacks != 0, but t_dupacks &lt; tcprexmtthresh. The header
<BR>
prediction code handles such an ACK, but doesn't seem to set t_dupacks
<BR>
to 0. Isn't possible that we may end up doing a false fast retransmit
<BR>
sometime later? It is hard to see from the code whether this case is
<BR>
correctly handled or not.
<BR>
<P>Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>S.R.
