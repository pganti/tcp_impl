<EM>&gt;         In this trace, the application process is terminated on Machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         D at approximately 13:48:36.34 and it sends the FIN with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         window opened again (since it properly discarded the previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         received data). Machine C promptly sends more data, causing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Machine D to reset the connection since it can not deliver the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         data to the application.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is it stated someplace that a window update should not be taken as an
<BR>
indication that the data has been received into the application? If
<BR>
&quot;feels&quot; as though there is an implicit assumption that if the window
<BR>
advances, data has been presented to the application - for instance,
<BR>
from 1122, section 4.2.2.14
<BR>
<P>&quot;When the application program subsequently consumes the data and
<BR>
increases the available receive buffer space again...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Would it be better to reset upon a window probe?
<BR>
<P>Or is this an area where we say that an applicaiton needs its own
<BR>
app-level protocol for what was and was not received?
