<EM>&gt; Im not arguing that der Mouse is doing the right thing in his circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But we can't make every random faulty piece of equipment an item to assess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when evaluating the need for keepalives.
</EM><BR>
<P>It isn't a &quot;faulty piece of equipment&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The fact is that clients die and leave state hanging in servers. You
<BR>
connect to a machine and your machine is blown off the net, and from
<BR>
then until the end of time all those connections hang. An OPTION (not, 
<BR>
*OPTION*) that lets you probe every several hours (HOURS!) with a tiny 
<BR>
packet to make sure that the other side still has some vague idea of
<BR>
your existance is hardly something that is necessitated by &quot;faulty
<BR>
equipment&quot;. It makes practical sense.
<BR>
<P>Sure, you might not want it running on every joe random protocol on
<BR>
every piece of equipment on earth, or even most, but you probably want
<BR>
it every once in a while, and the argument that it is never reasonable
<BR>
to make the facility available is just plain nonsense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the firewall case a firewall itself can (and should have) been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generating its own state checks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great, another piece of code to force people to write when it is just
<BR>
as easy to just leave the, what, dozen lines of code dealing with this 
<BR>
alone?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The general case &quot;my [link|firewall|proxy|...] doesnt work right therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Im going to cause a lot more traffic&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>What &quot;a lot more traffic&quot;, bub? As we've noted before, most
<BR>
implementations don't even send a keepalive until a link has been idle 
<BR>
for *hours*. And as we have noted, your &quot;make the application do it&quot;
<BR>
solution is no better than this.
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry to flame about this, but you're arguments just hold no water 
<BR>
at all.
