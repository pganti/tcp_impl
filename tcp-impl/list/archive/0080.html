<P>
<EM>&gt; Two points I think worth flagging: a clarification of terminology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for clients and servers in terms of closing/aborting/processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hanging/TCP connections neither transmitting nor receiving would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a good thing, particularly to distinguish application and protocol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stack behaviour.  We got confused and we're supposed to understand this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff :-) (oh, and I should have got hold of a network trace before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioning it).
</EM><BR>
<P>100% agreed!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The other point is that there's sufficient ambiguities in application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and TCP closing behaviour to merit a close look and a separate section
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the WG deliverables (bug listing &amp; spec clarification).
</EM><BR>
<P>Agree here as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the trace:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; client closes with FIN, server ACKs: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; client in FIN-WAIT-2 advertising zero window (which makes a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of sense since it cannot read any more)
</EM><BR>
<P>Here is where we still seem to be having a disagreement. If the client
<BR>
has &quot;destroyed&quot; the socket and is no longer using the socket, then TCP
<BR>
will never be able to deliver additional received data to the client
<BR>
application. In this scenario, it is wrong for the client TCP to
<BR>
respond with an ACK and window advertisement of zero, since doing so
<BR>
effectively tells its peer (the server): &quot;I'm out of buffer space
<BR>
right now, but try again in a little while and things should get
<BR>
better&quot;. Things will *never* get better in this case, leading to the
<BR>
problem of hung servers.
<BR>
<P>The trace doesn't give the full story. The trace is correct in the
<BR>
sense that a TCP connection in the FIN_WAIT_2 state is allowed to
<BR>
advertise a window of zero. However, it is correct to do so only if
<BR>
the client application is still reading data received on the socket,
<BR>
implying that the zero window is a temporary condition. That is not
<BR>
the scenario we have been discussing (i.e., the client destroys the
<BR>
socket)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; server in CLOSE-WAIT probing, all probes are ACKed with zero window.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me there are three approaches to fix this:
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I think the correct fix is to prevent the client TCP from going
<BR>
into the FIN_WAIT_x state, if in fact the application has disconnected
<BR>
from the socket.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1.  client flushes the connection, ideally with a RFC 1122 RST
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (application has to workaround with a SO_LINGER otherwise)
</EM><BR>
<P>I would agree that this is what should happen. Please note though,
<BR>
that the TCP should *not* go into FIN_WAIT_2 state at this point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.  server times out eventually. Apart from the load, here the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server would have to deduce from the zero window received in CLOSE-WAIT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the client really meant to do a half duplex close, as opposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to advertising a zero window because of momentary buffer exhaustion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Doing the above has the side effect of breaking other applications
<BR>
that are implemented correctly. For example, I could suspend a telnet
<BR>
session, which would could cause its TCP to (eventually) advertise a
<BR>
receive window of 0. The window advertisement would remain zero until
<BR>
I resumed the telnet session (i.e., an indeterminate amount of
<BR>
time). It would be wrong to terminate such connections after some
<BR>
arbitrary time limit (e.g., 15 minutes).
