Rick,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, there may still be sufficient cases of reasonable applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are not broken, but still &quot;suffer&quot; from Nagle, but I'm not sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (yet - I'm sure someone else will point some out :) what they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _Maybe_ something to do with pipelined http requests generating sub
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MSS responses? 
</EM><BR>
<P>If a response (could equally well be a request) sends an odd number of MSS 
<BR>
packets, and then wants to send one small packet, Nagle will block until all 
<BR>
the MSS packets have been acknowledged.  Because the response stream was an 
<BR>
odd number of packets, the remote TCP will probably decide not to ACK for 
<BR>
100ms or so, thus preventing the response from making it through.  So, the 
<BR>
response will take RTT+100ms (approximately) longer than it could have taken.
<BR>
<P>So, this is the application where there is an argument to be made that Nagle 
<BR>
(especially when coupled with delayed ACKs) is slowing things down somewhat.
<BR>
<P>With the proposed modification, the small packet will be allowed to follow the 
<BR>
MSS packets (assuming the window, congestion stuff, etc.).
<BR>
