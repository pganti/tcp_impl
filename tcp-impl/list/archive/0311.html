<P><EM>&gt; Yes, you've got a point.  The API should allow you to increase window size,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but only so large as makes sense from the link layer.  Currently BSD doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do that.
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO, letting the API adjust the window size is a hack. What if you
<BR>
have a LAN at home with a dedicated router that connects to the
<BR>
internet via a 28.8 modem? 
<BR>
<P>You really want the window size to match bandwidth X delay of the
<BR>
*path* being used, and you want that to be done automajically by
<BR>
TCP. The fundamental problem is that by dumping packets onto the path,
<BR>
you *increase* the delay artificially, as the sender's packets start
<BR>
sitting in queues. The actual max delay you get then is often *much*
<BR>
larger than what anybody wants. As you point out, the actual max delay
<BR>
is generally a function of the router.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; TCP tries to find the correct window size given the bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this is quite true. It tries to find the correct window
<BR>
size for the bandwidth X delay.  That is, it comes pretty close to
<BR>
finding the right sending *rate* (to match bandwidth) but it asks the
<BR>
network to buffer more packets than is needed to maintain that sending
<BR>
rate. It is this unfortunate &quot;over buffering&quot; that TCP does that is I
<BR>
think the cause of Jim's concern.
<BR>
<P>This (obviously) goes beyond the scope of this WG, but it seems like
<BR>
some of the results from TCP Vegas could be of use here. Vegas seems
<BR>
to do a better job of keeping extra (i.e., queued) packets out of the
<BR>
network. That is, if instantaneous throughput doesn't increase when
<BR>
the send window is increased, the send window is made a bit smaller
<BR>
(i.e., perhaps one segment smaller). In contrast, current TCPs simply
<BR>
increase the windows until there is a loss (at this point there is too
<BR>
much buffered in the network), and then decrease the window size by a
<BR>
*large* amount (i.e., to 1/2 its previous value).
