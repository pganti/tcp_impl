<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BTW - some of this latency is the modem being too clever about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; buffering and compressing. Shutting it down might decrease the latency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Another part is the use of large packets - it might be better to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; smaller packets with additional overhead. The overall transaction latency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would increase, but the time to first portion of response would decrease.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure.  The right thing to do (if HTTP did not have such verbose request
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response headers) would be to turn off all modem compression, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send the HTML content compressed.  Deflate compression does very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much better than anything in modems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Modems tend to use LZW, always (I trust) with at least 10-bit and at least
<BR>
sometimes more.  Judging from what Paul Mackerras has told me of his
<BR>
comparisons between BSD Compress (RFC 1977) and Deflate (RFC 1979) in his
<BR>
widely used `pppd`, the difference between Deflate and your typical modem
<BR>
on the data that is compressed should be about the difference you see
<BR>
between `compress` and `gzip`, or around a 10% improvement in compression
<BR>
ratio but at a ~2X cost in CPU cycles, and mostly on the side that does
<BR>
not have cycles to waste, the HTTP server.
<BR>
<P>Since most ISP's do not run hardware that supports VJ header compression,
<BR>
a modem using 12 or 14-bit LZW will be able to good things to those
<BR>
45-byte TCP/IP/PPP headers, which will probably almost always excede what
<BR>
the modem loses by using LZW over the application-data.
<BR>
<P>In other words, I bet that if you measure things, you'll find that
<BR>
turning off v.42+v.42bis improves latencies (and only when the link
<BR>
is mostly idle, as with `ping`) but always hurts throughput, even
<BR>
when moving pre-compressed application-data.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TCP connection vs. T/TCP.  Conventional TCP takes two...  I want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get one of them back...
</EM><BR>
<P>If you get it back, then how do you deal with the modified form of SYN
<BR>
attack?  As has been said repeatedly recently, an extra intial RTT paid
<BR>
by someone before the server commits any significant resources to the
<BR>
request seems necessary to defend against that attack.
<BR>
I've claimed that random-drop in the application would help, but people
<BR>
tend to not like random ideas.  Besides, even I admit it would help only
<BR>
when the ratio of good to bad connection attempts is small.
