<EM>&gt; From: Sean Doran &lt;<A HREF="mailto:smd@ebone.net?Subject=Re:%20New%20problems&In-Reply-To=&lt;199807172337.RAA00845@calcite.rhyolite.com&gt;">smd@ebone.net</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; | I agree completely with Constantinos concerns regarding non-adaptive traffic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At the risk of being screamed at for improperly Cc:-ing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two lists, I don't suppose anyone on either has any evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to support the assertion in Constantinos's first point?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's the same evidence that has been around for decades.  More, it is the
<BR>
same issue that is a root of the TLD DNS nonsense infesting the main IETF
<BR>
list.  Many people are unable to conceive of a working distributed,
<BR>
cooperative system, whether in politics, business, or network packets.
<BR>
As a result, they either demand a central commission to run it or rush to
<BR>
exploit its imagined weaknesses.  Thus, you get the ancient IBM token ring
<BR>
claims that CSMA/CD does not work (e.g. the 30% silliness), because mere
<BR>
statistics are in charge on an Ethernet.  Then came the FDDI claims that
<BR>
CSMA/CD does not work, followed the 100VG-AnyLAN stories.  Those were
<BR>
classic, since 100VG's claim to virtue was its central controller, and
<BR>
its most telling characteristic was significantly lower throughput than
<BR>
100BT.  About the same time came the claims of ATM gurus and sundry
<BR>
would-be politicians that IP and the Internet do not work technically or
<BR>
politically.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; | &gt;1. The problem with congestion unresponsive traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | &gt;is becoming increasingly serious as people find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | &gt;smart ways to cheat the net.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not likely to be a problem for at least a while.  The vast majority
<BR>
are prevented from play such games by their tiny, &lt;=128 kbit/sec
<BR>
connections.  The few that have connections fat enough to do significant
<BR>
harm would be noticed and handled administratively, if for some reason
<BR>
they forget the tragedy of the commons.  Any PC users that want to break
<BR>
slow-start can tell their browsers to use 40 instead of 2-4 connections
<BR>
when talking to the typical web page with its gazillions of blinking ads
<BR>
and banners.  They don't, because it does them no good, because they're
<BR>
throttled by 30 kbps modem links.
<BR>
<P>ATM is no more required by the theoretical existance of naughty TCP
<BR>
installations than analogous machinery is required by the proven existence
<BR>
of SYN-bombing, echo-port attacks, etc.  If it makes sense to use ATM
<BR>
because someone might cheat on slow-start, then it surely makes more sense
<BR>
to have every router in the core detect and filter streams of SYNs, packets
<BR>
from port 7 to port 7, or packets with surprising source addresses.
