<P>And I got wondering -- is that really true?  I think the answer is more
<BR>
complex.  During the initial slow start, clearly we've got N connections
<BR>
doubling their window in parallel.  But in other cases, the situation is
<BR>
more complex.
<BR>
<P>In particular, consider a case where all N connections are sending at their
<BR>
full window size, W, and compare their congestion response with a single
<BR>
connection sending with window size W*N.
<BR>
<P>If a router drops a datagram to signal congestion, the single connection
<BR>
will do a fast recovery and resume sending with window size of W(N/2).
<BR>
With N connections, one connection will do a fast recover and resume sending
<BR>
with window size W/2 -- so the N connections have an effective window of
<BR>
W((2N-1)/2) or nearly twice as large as the single connection.
<BR>
<P>We can continue this logic a bit further.  Suppose that after a little while
<BR>
(and RTT or two) the link is still congested and we drop another datagram.
<BR>
The single connection will scale back to W(N/4).  The N connections will do
<BR>
one of two things.  If the dropped datagram is for a different connection
<BR>
from the original one, we'll shrink the window to W(N-1) (i.e. we're now
<BR>
roughly 4 times bigger than the single connection).  If the dropped datagram
<BR>
is for the same connection as before we'll shrink to W((4N-3)/4).
<BR>
<P>Note that, in this case, we'd like all N connections to reduce their
<BR>
windows, but instead we're getting just one -- with the result that we're
<BR>
getting nothing close to exponential reductions.
