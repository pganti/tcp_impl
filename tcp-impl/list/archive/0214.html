||So let me ask:
<BR>
Since I started the 2nd thread..
<BR>
||
<BR>
||        1.  Do we have agreement over the sender-should-set-PSH issue,
<BR>
||            that it's an implementation problem we should document?
<BR>
||
<BR>
yes.
<BR>
||        2.  Can we resolve the failure-to-retain by using wording that
<BR>
||            receivers must not &quot;routinely&quot; fail to do so?
<BR>
||
<BR>
yes.
<BR>
||            This come about because for the implementation where I observed
<BR>
||            this, as far as it could tell it simply never bothered retaining
<BR>
||            above-sequence data, even though it had plenty of memory.
<BR>
||            I suspect this was to simplify the implementation, but it seems
<BR>
||            clear that because of the bad congestion properties of this
<BR>
||            behavior, it should be fixed.  So I'm trying to separate 
<BR>
||            &quot;routinely&quot; doing so from &quot;occasionally&quot;.
<BR>
||
<BR>
however..
<BR>
||            Perhaps a different way to put it is that a TCP must have
<BR>
||            mechanism in place that allows it to retain a full window's
<BR>
||            worth of above-sequence data, without delving into specifics
<BR>
||            of when that mechanism might not be exercised.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see words to this effect (above) put into the wording to
<BR>
clarify the issue we have all thrashed thru.
