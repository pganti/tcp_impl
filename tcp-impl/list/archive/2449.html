</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you really want those connections to go away without more direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intervention, you might want to use an interface that inserts the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application between the receipt of the SYN and the sending of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SYN|ACK. I _think_ XTI is or can be such an interface. In that case, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would simply stop taking the request notificatoins and the clients would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; timeout on their connects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Rick:
<BR>
<P>I don't know of any TCP implementation that withholds the SYN-ACK until the
<BR>
application accepts the connection.  I do know that if you experiment with
<BR>
such a strategy, you will find that BSD-based implementations of FTP will
<BR>
be unable to successfully establish a data connection.  It's been a long time
<BR>
since I stumbled into this, so the details are fuzzy, but basically you get
<BR>
into a deadlock where the client doesn't try to accept the data connection
<BR>
until it receives a message on the control connection, but the server doesn't
<BR>
send that message on the control connection until the data connection is
<BR>
established.  This works only if the SYN-ACK for the data connection is sent
<BR>
without waiting for the accept.
<BR>
<P>It may be the case that XTI (or would that really be TPI?) intended for the
<BR>
application to control whether or not an inbound connection ever gets to
<BR>
established state.  This sounds like a pretty good idea, but having FTP break
<BR>
is not acceptable.  FTP implementations that work this way could, of course,
<BR>
be &quot;fixed&quot;, but that isn't going to happen.
