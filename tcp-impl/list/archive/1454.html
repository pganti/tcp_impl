<EM>&gt; ] Embedded systems with TCP/IP stacks in ROM are up in a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] seconds. See, for example, the AMD Net186 Network Appliance demo board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's another good point.  One saving grace is that such systems are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to have WWW servers hit by zillions of clients.  They are also less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to originate TCP connections, and so can hope their peers will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honor TIME-WAIT and pick new port numbers.  They are also simpler and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be fixed more easily.  On the other hand, their designers are even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more likely to take short cuts for speed over reliability and to feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pressures to start working sooner after a reboot.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no guarantee that an embedded web server will have the clients
<BR>
do the initial FIN is there? I suspect (not that I have any real
<BR>
data...) that concern for &quot;connection resources&quot; would be such that the
<BR>
embedded designer would be inclined to be aggressive in closing
<BR>
connections - ie not make much use of persistent connections where the
<BR>
chances are better that the client will initiate the close.
<BR>
<P>Those devices will have a fixed quantity of RAM etc right? I wonder if
<BR>
they will be written to stop accepting connections when there are no
<BR>
free control blocks (goodness), or if they will just decided to
<BR>
prematurely reuse a control blcok in TIME_WAIT (badness).

<P><EM>&gt; ]                                                           Big systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ] (VMS, MPE) take longer, but that's mostly due to hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That must involve a definition of &quot;hardware&quot; other than the one I use.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some platforms have hardware (ok, really firmware) that is more
<BR>
aggressice (conservative?) in start-up self tests than others. MPE
<BR>
(well, MPE/XL or now MPE/iX) is an OS that runs on PA-RISC which can
<BR>
have some rather lengthy self-tests for cache and CPU's and such. Newer
<BR>
systems of such flavor can disable many of these tests (implemented
<BR>
under pressure from customers looking for faster boot times....) though
<BR>
it probably still takes at least a couple minutes for such systems to
<BR>
boot all the way to the point that they are exchanging TCP segments.
<BR>
Perhaps not a full four minute 2*MSL, but probably more than two
<BR>
minutes. There is continuing pressure to reduce that boot time further.

-- 
today, an ACK takes just as many CPU cycles as a data segment...
these opinions are mine, all mine; HP might not want them anyway... :)
feel free to email, or post, but please do not do both...
