<P>
<EM>&gt; Is there any reason why it wouldn't be a good idea to use one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free bits in the TCP header as a `slow-start' bit to enable a sender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to indicate to the receiver that it is sending the first packet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a slow-start phase?
</EM><BR>
<P>I read this as &quot;what are the mechanisms for doing circuit-setup messages
<BR>
with TCP, and is it a good idea?&quot; Right now, the only circuit-setup
<BR>
message we have is the MSS option. I suppose that it would be possible
<BR>
to add a flag that indicated that slow start was in effect, but why stop
<BR>
there? Shouldn't we also add flags for congestion avoidance, current
<BR>
retransmission timer, and so forth? All of these things will affect the
<BR>
bi-directional exchange of data in some manner.
<BR>
<P>One could define a set of bits or options that passed this info back and
<BR>
forth. This would let the sender say &quot;I'm at multiple four with slow
<BR>
start&quot; and &quot;my retransmission timer is currently set to 28 ms&quot; for
<BR>
example. Or, going even further, it would be possible for one end-point
<BR>
to request certain values from the other end-point, like &quot;please use
<BR>
28ms&quot;. It's early on a saturday morning and I'm just going through mail
<BR>
so I can't really think of a situation where that would be useful, but
<BR>
if it needs to be advertised then it can probably benefit from being set
<BR>
as well. Probably.
<BR>
<P>There are lots of issues here of course. First and foremost is legacy
<BR>
support, which is the big thorn for all new options. It would take a
<BR>
really long time to update all of the existing products to use any new
<BR>
data in the header. Another issue is that lots of products out there
<BR>
don't do slow start, so passing the data would be irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>I guess my feeling is that the broader issue of circuit-negotiation
<BR>
should definitely be addressed, but that it is sufficiently complex that
<BR>
it should probably be tabled for TCPng whenever that gets started. Would
<BR>
it make life easier or harder, and who would be affected by these
<BR>
messages (developers? users? admins?).
<BR>
<P>I also think its time to start the work on TCPng.
<BR>
