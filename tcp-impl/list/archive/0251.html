<P>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I apologize that my comment is insufficiently clear.  See instead the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next section that appears to be the end of this OT send (labelled #3),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where #1 and #2 remain unacknowledged, yet a short MSS is sent:
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine...  Your statement was that a short packet was &quot;inexplicably followed
<BR>
by a full data packet&quot; and your conclusion was &quot;no Nagle algorithm!&quot;.  My
<BR>
apologies for not reading beyond this.  I'm sure this was not what you
<BR>
intended to say...
<BR>
<P>Your methodology for determining whether a TCP has implemented the Nagle
<BR>
algorithm is again suboptimal.  Run a simple application that does one byte
<BR>
writes.  If the TCP does not implement Nagle, you will see a series of packets
<BR>
with one byte in each.  If it does implement Nagle, then you will see the
<BR>
first byte go out, and then nothing until an ACK comes back, at which time
<BR>
you will see one or more aggregated packets come out.  If you do this with
<BR>
our implementation, you will see that do implement the Nagle algorithm.  You
<BR>
will still want answers to your questions about your trace.  You don't need
<BR>
to remind me.  I will post a discussion.  The bottom line will be that you
<BR>
will claim that we have not implemented the algorithm &quot;correctly&quot;, and I will
<BR>
claim that the intent of the algorithm has not been violated.  I may very well
<BR>
change some code as a result of the argument we haven't yet had ;-)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Finally, just to hit my point home, what is your required API mechanism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to turn off Nagle?
</EM><BR>
<P>Same as most...  Turn on TCP_NODELAY.  Your one-byte writes will all appear
<BR>
in single packets.  How does that relate to your point?
